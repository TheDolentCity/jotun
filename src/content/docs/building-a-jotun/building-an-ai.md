Jotun are deployed with a smart AI. They help Pilots perform all of their tasks and manage sub-routines for the Jotun such as scanning and evaluating reactor stability. Importantly, they are capable of autonomously operating the Jotun when the Pilot leaves the seat empty. These AI develop their own personalities over time.

### 1. Determine AI Model

Every AI has built-in programming that enhances their starting abilities prior to their deployment in the field. Each model comes with one range skill, weapon skill, and tactical skill.

Roll d10 or choose whichever model is best for your Jotun and then record the three skills it has access to.

| d10 | Model     | Range Skill   | Weapon Skill | Tactical Skill |
| --- | --------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1   | Artillery | Long-range    | Launchers    | Tracking       |
| 2   | Assault   | Medium-range  | Bullets      | Traversing     |
| 3   | Bastion   | Close-range   | Melee        | Defending      |
| 4   | Breacher  | Close-range   | Bullets      | Smashing       |
| 5   | Operator  | Close-range   | Energy       | Infiltrating   |
| 6   | Ronin     | Melee-range   | Melee        | Dueling        |
| 7   | Scorch    | Medium-range  | Incendiary   | Demolishing    |
| 8   | Sentinel  | Long-range    | Lasers       | Scanning       |
| 9   | Sniper    | Extreme-range | Cannons      | Scouting       |
| 0   | Witch     | Medium-range  | Energy       | Hacking        |

### 2. Determine AI Age

AI age abnormally. After about ten years their processing degrades and routinely errors. It is no longer safe to use them in operations and they are discarded. However, older AI have accumulated more knowledge than most.

Roll d10 to determine the age of your AI and how many extra skills it has:

| d10 | Age | Experience   |
| --- | --- | ------------ |
| 1   | 1   | One skill    |
| 2   | 2   | One skill    |
| 3   | 4   | Two skills   |
| 4   | 5   | Two skills   |
| 5   | 5   | Two skills   |
| 6   | 5   | Two skills   |
| 7   | 5   | Two skills   |
| 8   | 6   | Three skills |
| 9   | 8   | Three skills |
| 0   | 9   | Four skills  |

Choose a number of skills from this table based on your AI's experience (see above). You may choose multiple skills from the same column:

| Range Skills  | Weapon Skills | Tactical Skills |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Melee-range   | Bullets       | Defending       |
| Close-range   | Cannons       | Demolishing     |
| Medium-range  | Energy        | Dueling         |
| Long-range    | Launchers     | Hacking         |
| Extreme-range | Lasers        | Infiltrating    |
|               | Melee         | Scanning        |
|               | Missiles      | Scouting        |
|               |               | Smashing        |
|               |               | Tracking        |
|               |               | Traversing      |

### 3. Create AI Serial Number

Roll 2d10 to determine the first two characters and another 4d10 to determine the numbers in the serial. If you rolled `[3, 0, 3, 2, 9, 1]` you would get DZ-3291.

| d10 | First | Second |
| --- | ----- | ------ |
| 1   | B     | P      |
| 2   | C     | Q      |
| 3   | D     | R      |
| 4   | F     | S      |
| 5   | G     | T      |
| 6   | H     | V      |
| 7   | J     | W      |
| 8   | K     | X      |
| 9   | L     | Y      |
| 0   | M     | Z      |

Jotun AI are sometimes referred to with nicknames, abbreviations of their serial numbers, or by the name of the mechanicalJotun itself.
