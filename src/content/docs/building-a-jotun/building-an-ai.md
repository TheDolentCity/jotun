Jotun are deployed with a smart AI. They help pilots perform all of their tasks and manage sub-routines for the jotun such as scanning and evaluating reactor stability. Importantly, they are capable of autonomously operating the jotun when the pilot leaves the seat empty. These AI develop their own personalities over time.

### 1. Determine AI Model

Every AI has built-in programming that enhances their starting abilities prior to their deployment in the field. Each model comes with a weapon bonus, tech bonus, and skill bonus. Roll d10 or choose whichever model is best for your jotun and then record its bonuses.

- Weapon bonus grants a bonus to attacks with that keyword.
- Tech bonus grants a bonus to the listed tech action.
- Skill bonus grants a bonus on checks related to the skill.

| d10 | Model     | Weapon bonus  | Tech bonus  | Skill bonus      |
| --- | --------- | ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | Artillery | +1 Launchers  | +2 Lock On  | +1 Tracking      |
| 2   | Assault   | +1 Rifle      | +1 Enhance  | +2 Traversing    |
| 3   | Bastion   | +1 Melee      | +2 Shield   | +1 Defending     |
| 4   | Breacher  | +2 CQB        | +1 Enhance  | +1 Demolishing   |
| 5   | Operator  | +1 Energy     | +1 Invasion | +2 Infiltrating  |
| 6   | Ronin     | +2 Melee      | +1 Enhance  | +1 Disarming     |
| 7   | Scorch    | +1 Incendiary | +2 Overload | +1 Combustion    |
| 8   | Sentinel  | +1 Rifle      | +2 Scan     | +1 Communicating |
| 9   | Sniper    | +1 Cannons    | +1 Lock On  | +2 Accuracy      |
| 0   | Witch     | +1 Energy     | +2 Hack     | +1 Hacking       |

### 2. Create AI Serial Number

Roll 2d10 to determine the first two characters and another 4d10 to determine the numbers in the serial. If you rolled `[3, 0, 3, 2, 9, 1]` you would get DZ-3291.

| d10 | First | Second |
| --- | ----- | ------ |
| 1   | B     | P      |
| 2   | C     | Q      |
| 3   | D     | R      |
| 4   | F     | S      |
| 5   | G     | T      |
| 6   | H     | V      |
| 7   | J     | W      |
| 8   | K     | X      |
| 9   | L     | Y      |
| 0   | M     | Z      |

Jotun AI are sometimes referred to with nicknames, abbreviations of their serial numbers, or by the name of the mechanical Jotun itself. DZ-3291 might be "deezy" or "zed".
