Building a Jotun should be fun. Don't worry about min-maxing or stats. If your Jotun falls apart you can always rebuild it differently.

### 1. [Choose a Frame](/building-a-jotun/frames/)

A Jotun's frame determines its stats, ability scores, and available mounts. Most frames have passive bonuses or unique actions only they can perform to specialize in the field.

### 2. [Install Main Mount](/building-a-jotun/main-mounts/)

A main mount refers to equipment designed to be held in a Jotun's two hands. Every Jotun has a bipedal build with two arms that mimics that of a human. These are almost always weapons.

### 3. [Install Minor Mounts](/building-a-jotun/minor-mounts/)

Minor mounts are smaller mounting points that can only hold specialized equipment. Oftentimes these mounts have more utility than lethality.

### 4. [Install Major Mounts](/building-a-jotun/major-mounts/)

Major mounts are larger mounting points that can hold potent equipment like radar towers or powerful anti-mech weapons like missile launchers or laser cannons.

### 5. [Install Colossal Mount](/building-a-jotun/colossal-mounts/)

A mount so large that equipment mounted on it dwarfs the Jotun itself. Very few Jotun are built to hold such mounts, but they can be used to devastating effect.

### 6. [Build and Install an AI](/building-a-jotun/building-an-ai/)

Jotun are deployed with a smart AI. They help Pilots perform all of their tasks and manage sub-routines for the Jotun such as scanning and evaluating reactor stability.

### 7. Create Jotun Name

Roll 2d10 to determine the two words that make your Jotun name or make your own name.
