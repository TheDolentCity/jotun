title: Jotun Wounds
description: Details and tables for handling Jotun wounds.
---

When a jotun suffers a wound, you find the most relevant description for the type of wound and then roll a d4, adding your Jotun's current stress. A roll of 6 is the highest and results in the destruction of your Jotun, at least until a full repair.

## Rolling Random Mounts

Some wound results will require you to roll a random mount. Roll a d12. If the resulting mount exists on the jotun and the condition can be applied to it, then you have your answer. But if that mount is already disabled, it cannot be re-disabled and you must roll again.

| d12 | Random Mount   |
| --- | -------------- |
| 1   | Minor Mount    |
| 2   | Minor Mount    |
| 3   | Minor Mount    |
| 4   | Minor Mount    |
| 5   | Minor Mount    |
| 6   | Minor Mount    |
| 7   | Major Mount    |
| 8   | Major Mount    |
| 9   | Major Mount    |
| 10  | Major Mount    |
| 11  | Main Mount     |
| 12  | Colossal Mount |

## Kinetic Wounds

These wounds are often caused by melee and bullet weapons. They are effective at damaging massive objects and breaking the physical frame of a Jotun.

| d6  | Kinetic Wounds                                                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Heavy Blow → Knocked prone and impaired (until end of next turn)    |
| 2   | Direct Hit → A random mount on the jotun is disabled                |
| 3   | Reactor Damaged → Take 6 heat and impaired (until end of next turn) |
| 4   | Critical Strike → A random mount on the jotun is destroyed          |
| 5   | Motor System Crippled → Jotun is immobilized (requires repair)      |
| 6   | Torn Apart → Jotun destroyed and pilot rolls on injury table (+2)   |

## Energy Wounds

These wounds are often caused by laser and arc weapons. They are effective at piercing through a Jotun, striking important sub-systems.

| d6  | Energy Wounds                                                     |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Near Miss → Take 3 heat                                           |
| 2   | Direct Hit → A random mount on the jotun is disabled              |
| 3   | Computer Damaged → Jotun AI is offline (engineering save ends)    |
| 4   | Critical Strike → A random mount on the jotun is destroyed        |
| 5   | Optical System Crippled → Jotun is blinded (requires repair)      |
| 6   | Reactor Breached → Nuclear meltdown in 1d4 turns (at end of turn) |

## System Wounds

These wounds are often caused by experimental weapons and hacking technologies. They excel at attacking a Jotun's systems, debilitating important computer components and the Jotun AI itself.

| d6  | System Wounds                                                         |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Shocked → Take 2 heat and impaired (until end of next turn)           |
| 2   | Shocked → Take 2 heat and one mount disabled (until end of next turn) |
| 3   | Shocked → Take 2 heat and AI offline (engineering save ends)          |
| 4   | Shocked → Take 2 heat and immobilized (engineering save ends)         |
| 5   | Shocked → Take 2 heat and blinded (systems save ends)                 |
| 6   | Power Surge → Jotun is offline for 2d4 turns                          |

## Explosive Wounds

These wounds are often caused by artillery and grenade weapons. They are effective at damaging motor systems and knocking jotuns around with the force of the attack.

| d6  | Explosive Wounds                                                              |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Blasted → Knocked prone and knockback 2 away from attack                      |
| 2   | Direct Hit → A random mount on the jotun is disabled                          |
| 3   | Motors Damaged → Jotun is slowed (requires repair)                            |
| 4   | Critical Strike → Knocked prone and jotun is offline (until end of next turn) |
| 5   | Chassis Crippled → Jotun is impaired and exposed (requires repair)            |
| 6   | Destroyed → Jotun destroyed and pilot rolls on injury table (+2)              |

## Incendiary Wounds

These wounds are often caused by flame projector or charged weapons. They overheat a Jotun's reactor and can cause lingering burning damage.

| d6  | Incendiary Wounds                                                      |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Scorched → Jotun takes 2 heat and 1 flame damage                       |
| 2   | Direct Hit → A random mount on the jotun is disabled                   |
| 3   | Armor Damaged → Reduce armor by 1 (requires repair)                    |
| 4   | Critical Strike → Jotun takes 4 heat and 2 flame damage                |
| 5   | Chassis Melted → Jotun armor reduced to 0 (requires repair)            |
| 6   | Incinerated → Jotun destroyed and reactor meltdown at end of next turn |

## Massive Wounds

These wounds are often caused by weapons that far exceed normal military use against Jotun, like orbital railcannons or nuclear warheads. They are incredibly destructive and can kill instantaneously. If a massive wound were to occur against a Pilot outside a Jotun, they would be destroyed without a roll.

| d6  | Massive Wounds                                                         |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Massive Blow → Knocked prone, all mounts disabled, and +1 stress       |
| 2   | Broken → Knocked prone, all mounts destroyed, and +2 stress            |
| 3   | Direct Hit → Jotun destroyed and pilot rolls on injury table (+1)      |
| 4   | Critical Strike → Jotun destroyed and pilot rolls on injury table (+3) |
| 5   | Reactor cataclysm → Reactor meltdown immediately                       |
| 6   | Obliteration → There are no remains of the jotun or pilot              |
