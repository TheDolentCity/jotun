## Blunt Wounds

These wounds are often caused by melee and kinetic weapons. They are effective at damaging massive objects and breaking the physical frame of a Jotun.

| d10 | Blunt Wounds                                                   |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Smashed → knocked down                                         |
| 2   | Smashed → knocked down and thrown a good distance              |
| 3   | Chassis damaged → weakened mobility and strength               |
| 4   | Hand broken → unable to use one hand, struggle with main mount |
| 5   | Foot broken → unable to use one foot, struggle with moving     |
| 6   | Arms broken → unable to use hands or main mount                |
| 7   | Legs broken → unable to walk                                   |
| 8   | Chassis spine destroyed → unable to move chassis or mounts     |
| 9   | Reactor unstable → meltdown in d6 turns                        |
| 0   | Chassis destroyed → AI destroyed and severe pilot injury       |

## Piercing Wounds

These wounds are often caused by bullet, laser, and melee weapons. They are effective at striking important sub-systems on a Jotun, disabling them entirely as they are struck repeatedly.

| d10 | Piercing Wounds                                             |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Grazed                                                      |
| 2   | Chassis damaged → armor more vulnerable to piercing weapons |
| 3   | Chassis damaged → armor more vulnerable to piercing weapons |
| 4   | Pilot hit → moderate pilot piercing injury                  |
| 5   | Pilot hit → severe pilot piercing injury                    |
| 6   | Coolant hit → emergency reactor shutdown in 2d6 turns       |
| 7   | Computer hit → AI inactive in d6 turns                      |
| 8   | Reactor hit → meltdown in d6 turns                          |
| 9   | Spinal hit → chassis spine inactive in d6 turns             |
| 0   | Headshot → AI destroyed and severe pilot injury             |

## System Wounds

These wounds are often caused by experimental weapons and hacking technologies. They excel at attacking a Jotun's systems, debilitating important computer components and the Jotun AI itself.

| d10 | System Wounds                                                     |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Shocked → frozen for a moment                                     |
| 2   | Computer hit → scanning system is offline for d8 turns            |
| 3   | Computer hit → targeting system is offline for d8 turns           |
| 4   | Computer hit → optical system is offline for d8 turns             |
| 5   | Computer hit → motor system is offline for d6 turns               |
| 6   | Computer hit → AI is offline for d6 turns                         |
| 7   | Computer hit → power system is offline for d4 turns               |
| 8   | Reactor hit → meltdown in d4 turns                                |
| 9   | Chassis lost power → AI inactive and pilot trapped inside cockpit |
| 0   | Chassis power surge → AI destroyed, all systems overloading       |

## Explosive Wounds

These wounds are often caused by artillery and flame projector weapons. They overheat a Jotun's reactor and can cause lingering burning damage.

| d10 | Explosive Wounds                                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Blasted → knocked down and scorched                     |
| 2   | Chassis burned → reactor heats up                       |
| 3   | Armor burned → reactor heats up and armor weakened      |
| 4   | Chassis aflame → ongoing d4 explosive wounds            |
| 5   | Armor destroyed → reactor heats up and Jotun is exposed |
| 6   | Chassis aflame → ongoing d6 explosive wounds            |
| 7   | Limb destroyed → unable to use leg or arm               |
| 8   | Chassis aflame → ongoing d10 explosive wounds           |
| 9   | Reactor hit hard → meltdown in 1 turn                   |
| 0   | Reactor destroyed → immediate meltdown                  |

## Massive Wounds

These wounds are often caused by weapons that far exceed normal military use against Jotun, like orbital railcannons or nuclear warheads. They are incredibly destructive and can kill instantaneously. If a massive wound were to occur against a Pilot outside a Jotun, they would be destroyed without a roll.

| d10 | Massive Wounds                                                |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Smashed → knocked down and tossed, all power lost             |
| 2   | Chassis mutilated → d4 + 1 limbs are destroyed                |
| 3   | Reactor hit → meltdown in d4 turns                            |
| 4   | Reactor hit hard → meltdown in 1 turn                         |
| 5   | Chassis smashed → unable to move chassis or mounts            |
| 6   | Chassis ripped → AI destroyed and pilot has a severe injury   |
| 7   | Chassis shredded → AI destroyed and pilot has a mortal injury |
| 8   | Cockpit destroyed → AI survives and pilot is killed           |
| 9   | Reactor destroyed → immediate meltdown                        |
| 0   | Jotun obliterated → there are no remains                      |
