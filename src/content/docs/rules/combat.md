## Turns

Pilots and Jotun execute actions on the same turn. A Jotun is either in "pilot-command" or "AI-command" mode.

### Pilot-Command Mode

In Pilot-command mode, the Pilot is inside the Jotun and can perform a movement and one action. The Jotun AI can perform one action as well or lend it's processing power to the Pilot to boost their action.

> #### Example 1
>
> A Pilot moves their Jotun to get an angle on a hostile Jotun at extreme range and then uses their action to fire a laser rifle. They hit the target, but only marginally damage it. Their AI uses its action to scan a nearby building, revealing hostiles waiting inside.

> #### Example 2
>
> A Pilot moves their Jotun to get an angle on a hostile Jotun at extreme range. They instruct their AI to help aim their shot and then uses their action to fire a laser rifle. They hit the target in a weakened fold of their armor, severing their arm.

### AI-Command Mode

In AI-command mode, the AI inside the Jotun can perform a movement and one action. The Pilot outside of the Jotun can also perform a movement and one action. This provides versatility, but both combatants are less effective when they're not working as a team.
