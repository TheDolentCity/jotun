## Taking action

Whoever describes taking action first, either GM or players, acts first. Have the players take all their turns together. If it’s unclear who described action first, make DEX checks to determine who acts.

## Power

When a pilot is inside of their mech, they have a resource called power. When a pilot is outside of their mech, they have 2 "power" and an AI may pilot the mech as if it has half power (rounded up). On your turn, spend power for each action you take. Most actions take 1 power. You regain all power at the start of your next turn. If an action is simple or very quick (making a thumbs up, drawing a sword, shouting a couple words over a radio, etc.) you don’t spend power.
