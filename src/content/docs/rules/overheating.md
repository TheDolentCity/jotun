When a jotun overheats, you roll a d4, adding your Jotun's current stress. A roll of 6 is the highest and results in the destruction of your Jotun, at least until a full repair.

## Overheating

Jotun can overheat from energy weapons, pushing a reactor too hard, or invasive hacking from a foe. When they do, their reactor becomes damaged, impairing their abilities, decreasing power output, and starting fires.

| d6  | Overheating                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Emergency → Jotun is exposed and impaired (until end of next turn)       |
| 2   | Destabilized → Jotun is impaired (engineering save ends)                 |
| 3   | Reactor Damaged → Jotun is exposed (engineering save ends)               |
| 4   | Combustion → Jotun takes 4 flame damage                                  |
| 5   | Reactor Crippled → Jotun decreases max power by 1 (requires full repair) |
| 6   | Conflagration → Reactor meltdown at the end of your next turn            |
