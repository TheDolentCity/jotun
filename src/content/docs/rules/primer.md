description: A quick overview of how to play the game.

This primer is a soft introduction to the Jotun rules. You will be somewhat familiar with many of these terms if you have played several versions of D&D or Pathfinder.

## Outside of Combat

Outside of combat, the game functions like a traditional tabletop roleplaying game. You describe what your character is doing, ask the GM questions, and roll some dice if the GM decides it's necessary.

## Active Combat

Combat boils down to two things: maximizing the damage you deal and minimizing the damage you take. Most missions have important objectives as well, but they will require you to defeat most of your enemies.

### Actions

Actions cost power to perform. Most actions costs 1 power and most Jotun have 3 power per turn. On your turn you only need to focus on a few actions most of the time. If you don't know what to do, take the following actions:

- **Move:** move your jotun a number of hexes equal to your speed to a more advantageous position.
- **Attack:** select a target within sensors and range of one of your mounts and roll the associated dice.

This will leave you with one power. That one power can be used for reactions to brace against damage, dodge attacks, or attack characters who leave your threat range.

### Health and Dying

Jotun and pilots have several stats such as HP, heat cap, and armor that represent their health. If some of these reach 0 or lower, you need to roll on a table to see how bad the damage is and increase your character's stress. If you take too much stress, then your jotun or pilot will be destroyed.

- If your pilot HP reaches 0, you should: **Roll on the pilot wounds table**
- If your jotun HP reaches 0, you should: **Roll on the jotun wounds table**
- If your jotun exceeds its heat cap, you should: **Roll on the overheating table**

### Healing

Once you start to take damage or gain adverse conditions, you will likely need to use power to negate those effects. For example:

- If you're damaged, you can: **Repair**
- If you're on fire, you can: **Extinguish**
- If you're overheating, you can: **Vent**
- If you have a condition, you can: **Save**

If you are able to get downtime between missions and have access to a repair bay, you can perform a full repair. Your jotun returns to full strength, full repair cap, and full uses of limited mounts. You can also use this time to swap out mounts.
