title: FMF Chief Frank Webb
description: Notable details regarding Frank Webb's life.
---

_Tall, thin, gaunt, with long, white hair. 68 years old. She/Her._

Frank Webb was born in an inner-colony, but her parents moved to an outer colony for terraforming work when she was younger. Some local militia forces convinced her to join up after they got in a nasty bar fight. She was not only tough, but cold, and quickly rose through the ranks. The UHC appointed her Chief of Operations during the Frontier war as they thought she was strong-willed enough to stand up to the Federation and continue to function despite the massive amount of Frontier casualties that were about to occur. She stepped aside as head of the UHC after the war and formed the Council of Humanity, but retains the position of FMF Chief of Operations.
