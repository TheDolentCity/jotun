description: Notable details regarding Major Samuel Saxon's life.
---

_Stocky, stoic, and brave. Body is mostly prosthetics at this point. 62 years old. He/him._

Samuel Saxon was born on Harmony and grew up working long hours in the fields. He hated the life and moved to an inner-colony as soon as he could. After the massacre at Psi-Severon he returned to Harmony and joined the Militia. He was distinguished several times over, first when he lost a hand pulling militia-men out of a fire and last when he used his body to shield allies from a grenade. He miraculously survived, but required almost a full-body prosthesis to walk and breathe. Unwilling to lose a brave and unwavering leader, Chief of Operations Frank Webb promoted Saxon to Major and placed him aboard the FMF Freyja-class carrier, Lady of the Slain.
