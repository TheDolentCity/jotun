_Short, sharp bones, sunken eyes. 60 years old. He/him._

Captain Azov was in command of Lady of the Slain during the [Battle of Red Stars](../campaigns/first-strike/battle-of-red-stars/). His peerless piloting and bravery led to the loss of his life and the destruction of his ship, but gave Red Team a chance to ultimately reach the bridge of the enemy dreadnought and end the battle, potentially saving Mars from destruction.
