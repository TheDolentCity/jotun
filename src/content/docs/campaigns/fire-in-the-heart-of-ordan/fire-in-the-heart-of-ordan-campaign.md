This campaign details several operations led by Commander James during the Ventiri invasion of Ordan. Several squads of five Jotun pilots were deployed to Nill, the Many Ringed City, where the fighting was heaviest.

## Background

The year is 2597 AST.

With the invention of Jotun, twenty foot tall bipedal war mechs, the Frontier has freed itself from the yoke of the fascist One Earth Alliance. But peace was not meant to last.

Earth was destroyed.

The bastards that did it call themselves “The Ventiri.” They tried to do the same to Mars, but a brave few souls stopped them and destroyed their dreadnought. Despite the victory, our losses were significant.

Now the Ventiri have regrouped and invaded Ordan, a metropolis world and headquarters of Dretyl Armory. The Frontier Militia is sending all nearby forces to engage.

Get to your Bifrost pods and standby for drop pilots.
