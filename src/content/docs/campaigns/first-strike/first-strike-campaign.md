This campaign details three operations led by Major Saxon aboard the that occurred following the destruction of Earth. One squad of three Jotun Pilots were deployed to Venus, Titan, and ████ while another squad of three was deployed to Earth and ████.

## Background

As of yet, not much is known about the Fall of Earth. Sol satellites captured images of an unknown fleet appearing through a massive subspace tear. They also captured images of destroyed orbital emplacements and Earth's surface. Cities were leveled, the atmosphere was filled with soot, and wide swaths of the world appear scorched.

No other United Human Colonies forces were present in the Sol system at the time. It is unknown who constructed this fleet, what their goals are, or how many planets in the Sol system have been destroyed. The United Human Colonies are mobilizing Jotun Pilots for insurrections into the system.

## Operations

This campaign was comprised of ████ Jotun operations:

- [Operation Dust Demon](./operation-dust-demon/): a raid of intelligence data from the Arcadia Research Station on Venus.
- [Operation Diving Bell](./operation-diving-bell/): an engagement against an enemy base on the Ocean moon Titan.
- [Operation Crystal Eye](./operation-crystal-eye/): a raid of sample data from Fallen Earth.
- [Battle of Red Stars](./battle-of-red-stars/): a battle that included naval combat above and on the surface of Mars.
