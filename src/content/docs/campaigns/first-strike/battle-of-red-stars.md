## 3. SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS

<section class="pl-14">

### `A` PHASE #1

<section class="pl-14">

#### `I` Routine naval operations.

The naval defense group made up of ten squadrons, codenamed _Red Fleet_, held defensive positions in high-orbit and interplanetary space near Mars at 0645 hours. Orbital defense platforms _Camingo_, _Friday_, and _Damascus_ were on high-alert in near-orbit space. Subspace ruptures were detected at 0646 hours by the smart A.I. Periphon aboard the Odin-class cruiser _Under Red Stars_. Vice Admiral Johanna, the commander of _Red Fleet_, ordered all forces to orient towards subspace ruptures and prepare to engage hostile forces.

#### `II` Crossfire on enemy fleet.

An enemy fleet, previously designated _Kraken Fleet_, appeared at 0647 hours with a dreadnought, three carriers, and dozens of destroyers. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th squadrons moved into a traditional x-maneuver crossfire position targeting the subspace rupture at 0647 hours. At 0648 hours _Red Fleet_ fired magnetic railcannons, missile pods, and launched 4,421 interceptor FL-716 Spears. Before any targets were hit, _Kraken Fleet_ performed an accurate, near-planetary, subspace jump that positioned them below _Red Fleet_ and oriented perpendicular with weapons facing the FMF naval forces. This maneuver was not previously thought to be possible and analysis shows that our computers and subspace engines are not capable of performing such jumps. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th squadrons took evasive action, but were struck by allied missile pods. The damage was minimal, but lowered their shields and damaged their armor. Of the 4,421 Spears, only 2,983 survived the hailstorm of missiles.

#### `III` Destruction of four squadrons.

Destroyers from _Kraken Fleet_ advanced and fired magnetic railcannons and missile pods at the weakened 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th squadrons from close range. The rest of _Red Fleet_ was unable to provide close fire support without the threat of striking their allied squadrons. All four squadrons were destroyed or drifting by 0650 hours. Remaining Spears engaged the enemy to little effect before being destroyed by flak defense systems. In less than four minutes, _Red Fleet_ was reduced to 58% of its initial strength of 102 ships.

#### `III` Destruction of `Under Red Stars`.

Vice Admiral Johanna ordered remaining _Red Fleet_ squadrons to evade, defend, and move to Rally Point Alpha on the other side of Mars. This left all three orbital defense platforms undefended against _Kraken Fleet_. They wrecked several hostile destroyers, but were ultimately destroyed. Hostile carriers began deploying ground forces across the surface of Mars. The dreadnought from _Kraken Fleet_ pursued _Under Red Stars_. Vice Admiral Johanna ordered the helmsman to navigate a course away from the rest of _Red Fleet_. This bought the fleet unencumbered time to regroup and rearm on the dark side of Mars. _Under Red Stars_ launched everything they had at the enemy Dreadnought. They succeeded at damaging its shield generator, but lost all hands in the process at 0656. Before its destruction, Ensign Saxon sent a long-range transmission detailing the attack to all FMF naval forces.

### `B` PHASE #2

<section class="pl-14">

#### `I` Intervention of Battle Group Vortex.

Captain Azov received Ensign Saxon's transmission at 0702 aboard _Lady of the Slain_. He coordinated a response with Major Saxon and Lieutenant Valkyrie. The determination was made that a _Blue Team_ commanded by ARC, PHOTON, and CINDER would defend a high priority location dubbed "Amber Base", a _Red Team_ commanded by BEAR, LENNY, and FIREBIRD would board the hostile dreadnought, and FMF naval forces would provide close fire support to both groups. The smart A.I. Ronan performed a subspace jump at 0706 and _Battle Group Vortex_ arrived in Mars orbit at 0712. The remains of `Red Fleet` had engaged the enemy forces at 0710 and were taking significant losses. Red Team was launched via bifrost pods into the side of the dreadnought and began a strike to reach the bridge. All bifrost pods, hammer ships, and non-essential personnel were deployed with _Blue Team_ from _Lady of the Slain_ to the surface of Mars near Amber Base.

#### `II` Defense of Amber Base.

Hostile forces deployed two ogres, two battalions of trolls, and over three battalions of goblins over the course of ten minutes. ARC, PHOTON, and CINDER engaged these forces alongside ten allied Jotun and Lieutenant Valkyrie. By 0717, most hostile forces had been destroyed seven allied Jotun had fallen as well. Lieutenant Valkyrie ordered ARC to help her operate the experimental █████████ ███████.

#### `III` Destruction of Battle Group Vortex.

The _Grafton_ and _Mohawk_ were the first to fall to the dreadnought, but were soon followed by _Golden Hour_, _Heart of Pluto_, _Beneath Atlantis_, and _Memory of Thunder_. At 0718, _Red Team_ was pinned down near the bridge of the dreadnought. Captain Azov exposed _Lady of the Slain_ to close-range enemy fire to provide fire support with the remaining unused bifrost pods along the ship's underside. This cleared the way for _Red Team_, but _Lady of the Slain_ was destroyed.

#### `IV` Defeating the dreadnought.

Lieutenant Valkyrie activated the █████████ ███████ at 0719 hours, cutting the dreadnought in half. This removed its ability to maneuver or access subspace. Lieutenant Valkyrie was KIA from the use of the █████████ ███████. _Red Team_ reached the bridge and encountered a ███-████ ████, ███████ █████. If it was not for the ████████ shine ███ would appear █████. ███ held up a hand and █████████ a missile from LENNY, killing BEAR. FIREBIRD managed to shoot ███ with a Yippee to little effect. The █████ broke FIREBIRD's arm with a █████ ██ ███ █████. Bridge warnings aboard the dreadnought alerted everyone to a nearby subspace rupture. Alarmed by this, the █████ opened a small ███ in ████████ and ████. LENNY and FIREBIRD eliminated the remaining goblins on the bridge, but died of their wounds.

#### `V` Arrival of Battle Group Sleipnir.

_Battle Group Sleipnir_ arrived at 0722 hours. Outmatched 2:1, the remaining hostile forces with working subspace engines fled from the battle. The few hostile trolls remaining near Amber Base were destroyed, leaving ARC, PHOTON, and CINDER as the only surviving FMF forces. The dreadnought was captured and cleared of all hostile forces over the course of several hours.

#### `VI` Loss of Atris 'ARC' Cotte.

At 0723 hours, allied forces entered Amber Base and secured ███ ████, but could not find any trace of Atris 'ARC' Cotte. Preliminary analysis of ███████ radiation at Amber Base indicated more than one ████ discharge in the past hour. At this point, ARC has been reported MIA.
