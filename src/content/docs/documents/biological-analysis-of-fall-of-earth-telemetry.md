This is `Codename Surgeon`. This transcript of my analysis was created using my voice. Images are attached.

The purpose of this analysis is to find the answer to three pressing questions: what does the imagery of the Fall of Earth capture, what does the abnormal biological data recovered from Earth indicate, and how was Earth destroyed?

I have a concrete answer to the second question, but IR imagery corruption has made answering the first or third in a definitive manner impossible. Conclusion is impossible and I will recommend 4th Command collect more samples from Earth and possibly █████ to establish an exact pathology.

From here on out I will refer to the Fall of Earth as the "Event".

## QUESTION ONE: What does the imagery of the Fall of Earth capture?

Images were captured during the Event only by estranged satellites. Orbiting and nearby satellites were destroyed by the hostile fleet on entry. Solar radiation also impacted the imagery transfer and created significant noise.

Prior to the Event, images capture several smaller vessels launching from the hostile fleet and landing in different locations across Earth.

**Hypothesis:** The hostile fleet had some weapon or tool that they deployed to Earth in order to trigger the Event.

Most of the images capture an Earth with clouds of black and brown smoke, obscuring most of the continents and oceans. What little gaps in cloud cover exist, likely caused by high winds due to temperature fluctuations, expose a fiery Earth. Magma flows freely from active and extinct volcanoes. Metropolitan mega-infrastructure cannot be discerned.

**Hypothesis:** Volcanic activity and mega-infrastructure collapse were both triggered by seismic activity. Seismic activity powerful enough to create this level of volcanic activity would also be able to destroy dams, nuclear reactors, and level any human-made structures, causing immediate and widespread destruction.

Imagery also captures unknown massive objects near the state of Great Maine. This object(s) is large enough to poke through the clouds in several images. It does not appear machine like in shape or nature, but is as big or bigger than an Odin-class cruiser.

Peculiarly, there are no images shown with this object being deployed from the hostile forces or retreating from Earth after the Event. The sample team was also unable to identify or find this object during Operation: CRYSTAL EYE.

**Hypothesis:** The object(s) in question originated from Earth itself, but was destroyed along with the rest of Earth due to the seismic and volcanic activity.

## QUESTION TWO: What does the abnormal biological data recovered from Earth indicate?

Atmospheric and soil samples confirm that temperatures rose rapidly during the Event. Analysis reveals that temperatures across the globe rose to an average of 60°C, with lower temperatures in extremely cold climates and even higher spikes along the Ring of Fire and Deccan Traps.

This seems like it was caused primarily by two factors: magma pouring through the Earth's mantle in herebefore unseen volumes along with a massive amount of atmospheric soot, trapping this increased heat. This far surpassed the worst models for nuclear winter and recorded lethality of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

Additionally, the collapse of human infrastructure and meltdown of massive nuclear reactors could have contributed to the increased heat and radiation in the oceans and atmosphere.

**Conclusion:** Earth was destroyed by unexpected, massive, widespread seismic and volcanic activity.

But there is a curious piece of data in the atmospheric samples that cannot be ignored. Each sample contained unreasonably massive ppm reports of β-proteins. Chemical and biological analysis has resulted in a baffling confusion: these proteins are an aerosolized form of β-keratin.

In other words, the atmosphere of Earth is not only filled with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (soot), but also beta-keratins, a fibrous protein that is only found in biomass like reptiles and birds. According to the density of the proteins in these samples and calculations performed by Rosie, if every sauropsid on Earth was aerosolized we would still be many orders of magnitude away from this density.

**Conclusion:** Somewhere on Earth during the Event, there was a massive biomass with extensive amounts of β-keratin that was vaporized or obliterated, launching its proteins into the clouds of soot in Earth's atmosphere.

## QUESTION THREE: How was Earth destroyed?

**Hypothesis:** The massive object(s) captured in satellite imagery and the source of the β-keratin are one in the same. The object was a massive biomass. This would explain the presence of β-proteins in the atmosphere and the inability to find the object. Like all other biomass on Earth, it was destroyed.

**EDIT**: Upon further inquiry, I have been forced, against my will, to record further hypothesis. I must emphasize that further hypothesis has little scientific backing and should not be regarded with any level of certainty or value.

**Hypothesis:** The massive object was a ██████ ████████. It originated on Earth and █████ ███████ ███ Mantle. ██████ machinery increased seismic activity which triggered a "████████". The ████████ █████████ ███ seismic activity which ███ ██ ███ ████ ██ Earth. The machinery on █████ indicates that there are ████ █████████ ████ ████; possibly in the Sol system ██ ██████. The enemy has some ██████ █████████ regarding these █████████. It is possible they know how to ██████ ███ █████ ██ ███ ██████.

This leads to even greater questions that I will not speculate the answer to, even under threat of execution: "If this new enemy ███ ███ █████ ████ ███████ then ███ ███? Are they ██████ or █████ in origin?"
