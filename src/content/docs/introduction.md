title: STANDBY FOR DROP, PILOT
description: A brief intro to this website and the Jotun RPG.
---

_The invention of faster than light travel changed humanity forever. Colonial efforts expanded far beyond the Sol system. Declaring its capital on Earth, humanity reset its chronology on this date and the United Nations became the One Earth Federation (O.E.F.)._

_As the Frontier colonies expanded, the fascist O.E.F. grew more and more demanding of colonial resources. An orbital bombardment of striking miners on Psi Severon launched the galaxy into all-out war. The Frontier Militia faced core worlds with far greater resources and a professional military. To even the odds, colonial engineers adapted mining exo-suits into weapons of war. They were dubbed JOTUN._

_The Frontier Militia Forces gained ground with their new war machines. In response, the O.E.F created TROLLS, mass-produced mechs with dumb AI systems instead of pilots. So the war became bloodier, and whole worlds were torn apart from the fighting._

_During the Battle of Mars, the Frontier Militia Forces destroyed the O.E.F. council, ending the war in one heartbeat. It took us over 20 years to build something new. But peace was not meant to last._

_Earth was destroyed._

_The bastards that did it call themselves “The Ventiri.” They tried to do the same to Mars, but a brave few souls stopped them and destroyed their dreadnought. Despite the victory, our losses were significant. Now they've begun invasions of planets throughout the galaxy and the Frontier Militia Forces are scrambling to respond. The decommissioned Jotun Corps has been reinstated and exceptional soldiers have been fast-tracked through pilot training._

_You are one of these pilots. Standby for drop._
