description: The steps to follow to build a Pilot.
---

Building a Pilot should be fun. Most of the time, you will find yourself inside of your Jotun, but missions may require you to leave the safety of the mech frame and engage in traditional warfare.

### 1. [Choose a Primary Weapon](/building-a-pilot/primary-weapons/)

Jotun Pilots are equipped with a primary weapon to protect them against infantry and inhospitable wildlife. These weapons are also carried by common soldiers of the Frontier.

### 2. [Choose a Secondary Weapon](/building-a-pilot/secondary-weapons/)

Jotun Pilots are equipped with a secondary weapon as a backup or for specialized target scenario. Many of these weapons are only distributed to Pilots.

### 3. [Choose an Ordnance Weapon](/building-a-pilot/ordnance-weapons/)

Jotun Pilots are equipped with heavy ordnance to protect them against heavy threats like infantry battalions or Trolls.

### 4. [Choose a Combat Suit](/building-a-pilot/combat-suits/)

Jotun Pilots are equipped with C-SUITs, enhanced combat suits to protect them and provide additional utility out in the field.

### 5. Choose Background and Skills

Jotun Pilots might be the best of the best now, but most of them had a career or training before joining the military. Roll d10 for a background and 3d10 for your skills or choose your own.

| d10 | Background | Skill                  |
| --- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 1   | Doctor     | Apply Fists To Faces   |
| 2   | Farmer     | Explode Something Big  |
| 3   | Hacker     | Fix Something Physical |
| 4   | Marshal    | Hack Something Digital |
| 5   | Mechanic   | Investigate A Mystery  |
| 6   | Mercenary  | Keep Pushing Forward   |
| 7   | Miner      | Lead Military Forces   |
| 8   | Noble      | Sneak Past The Enemy   |
| 9   | Outlaw     | Spy On The Enemy       |
| 0   | Scientist  | Stop The Bleeding      |

### 6. Build Backstory

You can start to build a backstory using the following tables.

| d10 | Region         |
| --- | -------------- |
| 0   | Core           |
| 1-2 | Inner Colonies |
| 3-9 | Outer Colonies |

| d10 | Core - Homeworld                                               |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | Earth, a corporate metropolis that has atrophied after the war |
| 1-2 | Titan, an ocean world with advanced scientific programs        |
| 3-5 | Luna, a massive trade port with constant traffic               |
| 6-9 | Mars, a recovering refinery planet crippled by the war         |

| d10 | Inner Colonies - Homeworld                           |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | LOST, a world wiped out by the One Earth Federation  |
| 1-2 | Allfax, a shipwright refinery and port               |
| 3-5 | Merivo, a trade hub for the inner colonies           |
| 6-9 | Sabon, a mining world covered in thick sand and rock |

| d10 | Outer Colonies - Homeworld                                                   |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0   | Psi Severon, a poor company-owned asteroid that never recovered from the war |
| 1-2 | Erud Minor, a moon with rare minerals needed for subspace engines            |
| 3-5 | Erud Major, the home of the Frontier Militia Forces                          |
| 6-9 | Harmony, a massive agricultural exporter                                     |

Now answer the following questions with whatever level of detail you like:

- How old are you? Keep in mind, the Frontier War was 22 years ago.
- Did you fight in the Frontier War?
- What is one thing you hate about your homeworld?
- What is one thing you love about your homeworld?
- Why did you want to become a Jotun Pilot?
- What previous military experience did you have (if any)? Almost all Jotun Pilots have prior experience before signing up.
