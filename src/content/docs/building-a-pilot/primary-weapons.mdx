Jotun Pilots are equipped with a primary weapon to protect them against infantry and inhospitable wildlife. These weapons are also carried by common soldiers of the Frontier.

    description="The TC-171 carbine is an anti-personnel, fully-automatic carbine by Tammen Armory. It is the standard rifle used by Frontier and Core worlds alike. It has few flaws as it is reliable, hard-hitting, and capable of rapid-fire. Many pilots eschew its general-use case for more specialized weapons." />

    description="The TD-15 Smart Shotgun is an auto-tracking, anti-personnel weapon made as a joint venture between Tammen and Dretyl Armory. It has an advanced AI processor installed along with a laser-based tracking device. Flechette pellets fired from the shotgun automatically identify and track the target they were fired at, resulting in higher accuracy. However, Jotun Command recommended pilots stop using this shotgun. There have been numerous incidents of friendly fire and damage to the Dretyl processing unit renders the weapon inoperable." />
