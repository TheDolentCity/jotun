Jotun Pilots are equipped with C-SUITs, enhanced combat suits to protect them and provide additional utility out in the field.

<Aside>
  Each C-SUIT is equipped with a thruster belt. This belt has several small engines that provide bursts of thrust. This
  allows Pilots to evade easier, run faster, jump further, and fall farther, than normal infantry.

### Assault C-SUIT

This suit features exo-skeletal modifications from the Escheron Armory. These grant the wearer increased physical strength, pushing their athletic limits far beyond that of a normal human. It also includes several utilities that can benefit from the exo-skeletal motors, such as a grappling hook and a shoulder-mounted, long-range grenade launcher.

### Heavy C-SUIT

This suit features armor modifications from the Hadrago Armory. This modification is not subtle. Jotun armor plates are essentially bolted onto a normal C-SUIT. These plates are incredibly heavy and an inter-skeletal system was added just to bear the weight. Pilots in Heavy C-SUITs are resistant to Jotun-tier weaponry. In testing, dummies have walked away largely uninjured from direct rocket strikes from Sarm weapons. However, the increased weight reduces a Pilot's mobility to that of a normal infantry unit.

### Mobility C-SUIT

This suit features thruster modifications from the Sarm Armory. In addition to a thruster belt, this C-SUIT adds thrusters to the boots and hands, allowing the Pilot to enter a hover state. Experienced Pilots may override safety protocols to burn all the thrusters at once and travel great distances or even fly temporarily, but doing so burns out the thrusters for a significant time.

### Recon C-SUIT

This suit features active camouflage modifications from the Dretyl Armory. This includes a large battery pack and many enviro-projectors across the suit. The camouflage leaves a slight optical sheen when active and while the enviro-projectors can obscure you from heat and computer sensors, this system is not perfect. The active camouflage battery recharges quickly, but only lasts for a short time.
