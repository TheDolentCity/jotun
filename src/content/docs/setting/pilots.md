## Known Pilots

### Atris "ARC" Cotte

Atris was a miner on Erud Minor until the age of 23 when he joined the militia forces as infantry two years before the end of the Frontier war. Being a miner Atris had some experience with heavy mining rigs. Three months before the battle of Mars Atris was recommended to the Jotun program. He was still in training during the battle of Mars and since has been deployed in the inner colonies after the fall of the One Earth Federation. Growing up on Erud Minor Atris grew to hate the confined spaces of the bases, and enjoys being deployed on new planets.

### Dak "CINDER" Breacher

Dak Breacher was originally born Darius Bastion the second son of Marcus and Eliza Bastion. The Bastion family was a noble house that had control over the planet of Inverness. Their power came from the mass production of very powerful defensive equipment and weaponry along with their massive fortress home, hence their family name of bastion. Darius, being born the second son and having no real chance of inheriting the family leadership, was shipped off to the military academy on Inverness in hopes that a child of the Bastion family becoming a powerful figure in the One Earth Federation military would bring even more power and influence to their family.

The years being estranged from his family and spending time in the military eroded almost any loyalty he had towards his family. While away on his first tour of duty in the frontier war he saw the truth of what was happening in the galaxy and the horrors that his family and the One Earth Federation were inflicting on the colonies. In that moment he chose to fight against his family and hopefully deal a blow to the One Earth Federation by preventing his family from sending any more armaments to the federation.

Using his family's influence he was able to have himself shipped back to Inverness to help train their military recruits. Once there he stole one of his familyâ€™s Jotuns and defected to the Frontier Militia that had begun to fight on Inverness. There he helped wage a ground war against the Bastion family and the One Earth Federation.

He was able to bring the militia up to the Bastion family fortress, the last stronghold of the Federation on Inverness. The militia was stuck there for several months unable to breach the walls of the fortress. That was until Darius self detonated his Jotun in a daring act creating a hole large enough for him to lead the troops through the walls eventually capturing the fortress and imprisoning his family effectively ending their control over Inverness.

After the fight Darius cut all ties with his family, changing his name to Dak and adopting the surname of Breacher as that is what his soldiers called him after the breaching of the bastion family fortress. Following this fight, Dak traveled off world to fight on various other fronts during the Frontier war.

Eventually the One Earth Federation made an attempt to recapture Inverness but the defense from the Militia was too tough and the planet was almost completely irradiated from orbital bombardments. Dak continued to fight even though his home world was destroyed, participating in many battles including the Battle of Mars.

### Lesie "PHOTON" Everson

Teenage thief/hacker who made a living stealing from mid level tech companies and lower nobles. I was caught and given the option of jail or joining the FMF during their war against One Earth. Served as a naval officer during the battle of mars and was one of the few frontier navy survivors (my ship was destroyed but I was rescued) after requesting a transfer to the Jotun division and was accepted because of my service record. Twenty two years later I'm a seasoned veteran who excels at reconcile and sustained engagements.
