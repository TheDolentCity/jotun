## Frank Webb, FMF Chief of Operations

_Tall, thin, gaunt, with long, white hair. 68 years old. She/Her._

Frank Webb was born in an inner-colony, but her parents moved to an outer colony for terraforming work when she was younger. Some local militia forces convinced her to join up after they got in a nasty bar fight. She was not only tough, but cold, and quickly rose through the ranks. The UHC appointed her Chief of Operations during the Frontier war as they thought she was strong-willed enough to stand up to the Federation and continue to function despite the massive amount of Frontier casualties that were about to occur. She stepped aside as head of the UHC after the war and formed the Council of Humanity, but retains the position of FMF Chief of Operations.

## Major Samuel Saxon

_Stocky, stoic, and brave. Body is mostly prosthetics at this point. 62 years old. He/him._

Samuel Saxon was born on Harmony and grew up working long hours in the fields. He hated the life and moved to an inner-colony as soon as he could. After the massacre at Psi-Severon he returned to Harmony and joined the Militia. He was distinguished several times over, first when he lost a hand pulling militia-men out of a fire and last when he used his body to shield allies from a grenade. He miraculously survived, but required almost a full-body prosthesis to walk and breathe. Unwilling to lose a brave and unwavering leader, Chief of Operations Frank Webb promoted Saxon to Major and placed him aboard the FMF Freyja-class carrier, Lady of the Slain.
