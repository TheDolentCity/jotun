The United Human Colonies, or UHC, was originally a separatist coalition formed following the [Massacre at Psi Severon](/setting/history#2438-ast---massacre-at-psi-severon) with the explicit goal of overthrowing the One Earth Federation.

## Council of Humanity

After the war ended, the UHC was the ruling government for the galaxy, led by the Council of Humanity. Each member of the Council is elected from voters across the galaxy and they appoint whoever they wish for positions under their domains, such as justice, labor, treasury, etc.

## Fiefdoms

The Council acts as diplomatic relations between galactic fiefdoms. Each fiefdom is comprised of one or more celestial bodies. Most fiefdoms are one planet, but it is also common to see a fiefdom rule over moons and nearby asteroids. A baron presides over managing the fiefdom and is the point of contact for UHC operations. Barons usually descend from the families who originally colonized the planet. If the UHC calls upon them, for any task, they must serve or they will break the United Human Accords and will fall out of UHC support. Each Baron has a dedicated force of Jotun Pilots that are on standby for UHC aid calls.

## Military

The UHC has the full power of the Frontier Militia Forces at its back. During the war, the FMF chief of operations acted as the head of state for the UHC. She stepped aside after the war and formed the Council of Humanity. Still, the UHC has a massive armada of naval ships, Jotun, and armed forces on standby. Peacetime and economic distress has made it difficult to deal with this situation. Many military installations have found their funding cut and troops sent home.

## Aid and Intervention

Each Fiefdom is left to their own devices, but can request aid from the UHC. This is a particularly sour point for many, as interventions in fiefdoms is frowned upon, but many barons abuse their authority as well. The UHC has taken a reserved approach due to their massive military. A violent overthrow of a baron may well be viewed as a replacement of the One Earth Federation's tyranny. Peace does not come easy after over a hundred years of war.
