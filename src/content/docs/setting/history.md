The invention of faster than light travel changed humanity forever. Colonial efforts expanded far beyond the Sol system. Declaring its capital on Earth, humanity reset its chronology on this date and the United Nations became the One Earth Federation. The galaxy used a new standardized dating system based off of Earth's year, the interstellar calendar. Dates before the invention of the subspace engine were marked BST (before subspace travel) and AST (after subspace travel). The present day is 2597 AST.

## 2541 AST - Massacre at Psi Severon

The One Earth Federation intervened on the part of several, large mining conglomerates to break the striking workforce aboard the asteroid of Psi Severon. It was especially brutal and included orbital strikes against unarmed civilians. This was the spark that started the 31 year war with the Frontier.

## 2542 AST - Invention of Jotun

One year into the war and the Frontier Militia was already losing horribly. Supply lines had been cut off and they did not have access to military hardware. The Frontier was made up of the best and brightest though. A team of engineers modified the twenty-foot tall exo-suits used by the mining conglomerates for war. They were dubbed Jotun.

## 2542 AST - Battle of Uberik IV

Two weeks after their invention, veteran miners were deployed with Jotun to the refueling docks on Uberik IV. They were armed with little more than industrial mining drills and lasers, but it was enough. The One Earth Federation forces were unprepared for this threat and were routed, leading to the first meaningful FMF victory. As the FMF took control of more and more armories over the years, the Jotun were upgraded with more modern military hardware.

## 2544 AST - Invention of Trolls

The One Earth Federation adapted to the Jotun threat by inventing their own military robotics: Trolls. They were similar in design and even based on the same mining template, but the One Earth Federation Council opted to remove the human cockpit and turn over control to a dumb AI. This would allow them to add more armor to the unit and produce and deploy them without human interaction. One Troll was no match for a Jotun, but the OEF could produce many more Trolls than the FMF had Jotun. And so the war continued for decades.

## 2575 AST - Battle of Mars

The Battle of Mars was the final battle in the Frontier war. It was fought on and above the surface of Mars by a combination of Jotun Pilots and a naval fleet.

The Pilots were tasked with the destruction of Mars's Troll refinery. A secret squad of veteran Pilots were given the most important mission of all: the delivery of a smart A.I. to the Federation Economic Regulatory Board that would dissolve and resolve all financial debts across the galaxy.

The Frontier navy suffered massive casualties that would leave their fleet crippled. It was a gamble. The fleet destroyed all of Earth's orbital defenses and naval defenses. This allowed a single destroyer—_Swine of War_—to fire off an orbital rail-cannon strike at Earth. This eliminated Earth's Federation Council in one blow, ending the war.

## 2575 AST - Dissolution of One Earth Federation

Despite destroying most of the Frontier's fleet, the One Earth Federation was forced to surrender. They were unable to produce Trolls after the loss of Mars and with their Federation Council killed, government officials were tearing each other to pieces.

The United Human Colonies stepped in and dissolved what remained of the One Earth Alliance's laws and government structures. They placed a responsible warden as the Baron of Earth.

## 2597 AST - Fall of Earth

As of yet, not much is known about the Fall of Earth. Sol satellites captured images of an unknown fleet appearing through a massive subspace tear. They also captured destroyed orbital emplacements and images of Earth's surface. Cities were leveled, the atmosphere was filled with dust, and wide swaths of the world have been scorched.

No other United Human Colonies forces were present in the Sol system at the time. It is unknown who constructed this fleet, what their goals are, or how many planets in the Sol system have been destroyed. The United Human Colonies are mobilizing Jotun Pilots for insurrections into the system.

## 2597 AST - Battle of Red Stars and Ventiri Broadcast

The naval strike group Basilisk intercepted a distress call from Red Fleet orbiting Mars and proceeded to attack an unknown enemy dreadnought until reinforcements arrived. The battle ended with the destruction of the dreadnought and the arrival of Battle Group Sleipnir. Several jotun pilots, along with Red Fleet and naval strike group Basilisk were destroyed.

After the battle, humanity received a galaxy-wide transmission from the Ventiri, the hostile faction that destroyed Earth. Its origins remain unclear, but one thing is for certain: the Ventiri will not stop until all humans are dead.
