The invention of faster than light travel changed humanity forever. Colonial efforts expanded far beyond the Sol system. Declaring its capital on Earth, humanity reset its chronology on this date and the United Nations became the One Earth Federation. The galaxy used a new standardized dating system based off of Earth's year, the interstellar calendar. Dates before the invention of the subspace engine were marked BST (before subspace travel) and AST (after subspace travel). The present day is 2597 AST.

## 2438 AST - Massacre at Psi Severon
The One Earth Federation intervened on the part of several, large mining conglomerates to break the striking workforce aboard the asteroid of Psi Severon. It was especially brutal and included orbital strikes against unarmed civilians. This was the spark that started the 100+ year war with the Frontier.

## 2575 AST - Battle of Mars
The Battle of Mars was the final battle in the Frontier war. It was fought on and above the surface of Mars by a combination of Jotun pilots and a naval fleet.

The Jotun pilots were tasked with the destruction of Mars's auto-mech refinery. A secret squad of veteran pilots were given the most important mission of all: the delivery of a hacked A.I. to the Federation Economic Regulatory Board that would dissolve and resolve all financial debts across the galaxy.

The Frontier navy suffered the greatest casualties, but destroyed orbital defenses that allowed them to fire off a single orbital rail-cannon strike at Earth which eliminated Earth's Federation Council in one blow.

## 2575 AST - Dissolution of One Earth Federation
Despite destroying most of the Frontier's fleet, the One Earth Federation was forced to surrender. They were unable to produce auto-mechs after the loss of Mars and with their Federation Council killed, government officials were tearing each other to pieces.

The United Human Colonies stepped in and dissolved what remained of the One Earth Alliance's laws and government structures. They placed a responsible warden as the Baron of Earth.

## 2597 AST - Fall of Earth
As of yet, not much is known about the Fall of Earth. Sol satellites captured images of an unknown fleet appearing through a massive subspace tear. They also captured destroyed orbital emplacements and images of Earth's surface. Cities were leveled, the atmosphere was filled with dust, and wide swaths of the world have been scorched.

Mars was quickly given the same treatment before the last of the Sol satellites were destroyed. No other United Human Colonies forces were present in the Sol system at the time.

It is unknown who constructed this fleet, what their goals are, or how many planets in the Sol system have been destroyed. The United Human Colonies are mobilizing Jotun pilots for insurrections into the system.
