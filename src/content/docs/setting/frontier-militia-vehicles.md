The Frontier Militia Forces have developed many military vehicles to support FAVCOM, MILCOM, and FLICOM operations.

## FAVCOM Vehicles

Frontier Flight Command maintains and deploys several naval vehicles for space-based warfare and quick transportation of FMF forces.

### FA-400 Odin-class Cruiser

A large naval vessel with heavy armor and weaponry. These are the largest warships in the FMF and almost always act as the command ships for a fleet.

### FA-408 Freyja-class Carrier

A large naval vessel with heavy armor, but little armaments. Its primary function is the transport and deployment of MILCOM and FLICOM forces to a terrestrial location.

### FA-424 Thor-class Destroyer

A large naval vessel that retains speed and maneuverability. It is moderately armored and contains significant armaments, almost rivaling that of a cruiser. They are often deployed as escorts for cruisers and carriers.

### FA-456 Baldr-class Corvette

A small naval vessel that is usually lightly armed and armored. They are versatile in their function however, oftentimes taking important supportive roles such as hosting advanced medical bays.

### FA-444 Loki-class Longship

A small, thin naval vessel that excels at stealth infiltration and exfiltration. These ships include electronic countermeasures, subspace drives, and long-range jammers. They have poor maneuverability due to their elongated shape; it is closer to piloting an archaic rocket than a modern starship.

## MILCOM Vehicles

Frontier Flight Command maintains and deploys several transport vehicles for terrestrial operations.

### MI-525 Halberd

A light reconnaissance vehicle with seating for up to six troops. Some models are deployed with weapon emplacements, heavier armor, or advanced surveillance equipment.

### MI-575 Mace

A heavy vehicle with seating for up to thirty troops. It is much slower than a MI-525 Halberd, but can seat a large number of troops and comes with heavier armor. The MI-575S Mace sacrifices capacity for five troops with the addition of a rotating cannon atop the vehicle.

## FLICOM Vehicles

Frontier Flight Command maintains and deploys several transport vehicles and both atmospheric and space-based fighter jets.

### FL-701 Bifrost Pod

A pod designed to drop marines from orbit onto a terrestrial surface. An enlarged model is used to deploy jotun and their pilots as well.

### FL-716 Spear

A long, thin fighter jet that seats two individuals, a pilot and a gunner. It is capable of both space and atmospheric combat. Its primary design is a fighter, it is also exceptional at interception, bombing, and direct attack on larger vessels.

### FL-750 Hammer

A large shuttle that seats two pilots and up to one-hundred passengers depending on the specific model. It is capable of both space and atmospheric transport and is the primary method for deploying marines from naval vessels.

### FL-770 Greathammer

A massive shuttle that seats up to four pilots and can accommodate up to four Hulk-sized Jotun and sixty passengers. It is capable of both space and atmospheric transport and is the primary method for retrieving Jotun from terrestrial locations.
