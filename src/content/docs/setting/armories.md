## Escheron

Escheron Armory is an arms manufacturer located in the Outer Colonies. Originally established as a Co-Op by a mercenary gang, Escheron rose quickly as a top arms dealer for their unflinching resolve to make weapons other armories thought useless or "simple". It turns out that Frontier Pilots loved their proprietary method for hardening and up-scaling traditional melee weapons into armor-piercing death bringers.

## Dretyl

Dretyl Armory is an arms manufacturer and software development organization located in the Core. Their namesake was a brilliant engineer who invented "smart" A.I. as we know it today. Despite building a well-regarded arms manufacturing company, Dretyl regretted that his A.I. were used to create Troll AI by the One Earth Alliance. To this day, Dretyl outputs weaponry and mech modifications that very few Pilots understand.

## Hadrago

Hadrago Armory is an arms manufacturer located in the Inner Colonies. Count Barnabus Hadrago III initially established Hadrago Armory as a show of strength to his political rivals. If Sarm Armory made a rocket that could reach space, Hadrago made a cannon that could shoot down a space ship. They also designed the "Monolith" Jotun frame as there weren't any existing frames that could support the weapons they were building.

## Klemon

Klemon Armory is an arms manufacturer located in the Outer Colonies. Many of their weapons are banned in the Frontier or registered as illegal against non-mechanical targets. They started as a colonial mining company, but found that it was cheaper to produce non-toxic retardant and flamethrowers for hazardous terrain clearing on terraforming planets. Their flamethrowers used a proprietary thermite-fuel to melt rock instead of excavating it. It turns out their tools were equally effective against humans and Jotun.

## Sarm

Sarm Armory is an arms manufacturer located in the Inner Colonies. They started as the manufacturer and supplier of colonial trade rockets. Now, they produce primarily naval weapons including ship-to-ship missiles and orbital munitions. When war broke out, it took little effort to adapt these weapons to a smaller Jotun-sized weapon.

## Tammen

Tammen Armory is an arms manufacturer located in the Core. The oldest existing manufacturer, they grew fat on government contracts and subsidies. Tammen produces almost every single bullet fired in this galaxy. Even if a Jotun is equipped with a Dretyl or Hadrago manufactured weapon, it still fires Tammen rounds. They stick to what works.

## Volgor

Volgor Armory is an arms manufacturer located in the Inner Colonies. It is the second oldest armory after Tammen. It began as a venture between a collective of physicists trying to crack nuclear fusion. Once they achieved that, they began building miniature reactors for large exo-suits, which went on to power Jotun. Volgor produces laser weaponry that integrates with their reactors. They do not claim any responsibility for reactor meltdowns triggered by their weapons.
