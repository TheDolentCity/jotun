description: Details of the Frontier Militia Forces.

The Frontier Militia Forces, or FMF, was created by the United Human Colonies coalition following the [Massacre at Psi Severon](/setting/history#2438-ast---massacre-at-psi-severon). They are the armed forces for UHC and represent the Frontier colonies in the Colony Revolt.

## Branches

The Frontier Militia Forces military organization is divided into three branches of command:

- [FAVCOM a.k.a. Frontier Militia Naval Command](/setting/frontier-militia-naval-command)
- [MILCOM a.k.a. Frontier Militia Ground Command](/setting/frontier-militia-ground-command)
- [FLICOM a.k.a. Frontier Militia Flight Command](/setting/frontier-militia-flight-command)

## Colony Revolt

Most outer colony planets had regulated militias since they could not rely on the One Earth Federation to provide support against outlaws. When the war started, these militias merged into one body under the FMF chief of operations, Frank Webb.

## Post-War Status

After the war, the Frontier had to reckon with the fact that they were now the de-facto interstellar military. De-armament procedures were slowly implemented. This was largely introduced by decreasing military budgets by the UHC. Chief of operations Webb opposed this measure, stating that there were still plenty of people throughout the galaxy who would like to see the return of the Federation. These calls were ignored. Many Jotun battalions have already been disbanded.
