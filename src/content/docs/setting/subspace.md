description: Details regarding subspace and how its traversed.

Subspace is a colloquial term used to refer to a complex 11th dimension where spacetime behaves abnormally from a human perspective. Traveling through subspace allows a pilot to travel faster than light, but requires incredibly complex computation to perform safely. This is done with a combination of smart A.I. and subspace engines.

## Subspace Engines

The subspace engine was invented in 1 BST (before subspace travel). It is a collection of quantum computers and vector geographies that can simulate the abnormalities of spacetime across multiple dimensions. These calculations can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few months depending on the complexity of the travel and the capabilities of the computers that help run the calculations.

When a set of calculations are complete, a Captain can initiate a "jump" and the subspace engine will project a portal, or subspace tear, in front of the ship. The subspace engine will guide the ship into the portal and be in charge of all navigation until another portal is created and the ship exits subspace.

Subspace is incredibly dangerous to travel without completed projections. It is also incredibly dangerous to produce a subspace portal in atmosphere or while performing complex maneuvers. Attempting to travel with any of the above conditions is likely to leave the starship in several pieces throughout the known galaxy.
