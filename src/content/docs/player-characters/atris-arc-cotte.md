Atris was a miner on Erud Minor until the age of 23 when he joined the militia forces as infantry two years before the end of the Frontier war. Being a miner Atris had some experience with heavy mining rigs. Three months before the battle of Mars Atris was recommended to the Jotun program. He was still in training during the battle of Mars and since has been deployed in the inner colonies after the fall of the One Earth Federation. Growing up on Erud Minor Atris grew to hate the confined spaces of the bases, and enjoys being deployed on new planets.
