description: Notable details regarding Lesie Everson's life.
---

Teenage thief/hacker who made a living stealing from mid level tech companies and lower nobles. I was caught and given the option of jail or joining the FMF during their war against One Earth. Served as a naval officer during the battle of mars and was one of the few frontier navy survivors (my ship was destroyed but I was rescued) after requesting a transfer to the Jotun division and was accepted because of my service record. Twenty two years later I'm a seasoned veteran who excels at reconcile and sustained engagements.

From Erud Major, the home of the Frontier Militia Forces
Pressed into service at 21
Bouncing around helping train
-returned to FMF to train new pilots and ended up on this mission because they need best pilots
-on the path to retirement and some high up position in FMF
