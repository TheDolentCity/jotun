## Primary Weapons
Jotun pilots are equipped with a primary weapon to protect them against infantry.

#### Tammen Mk II Hammer Shotgun
A shotgun with an optical sight that can see in the dark or smoke. Hits like a jotun punch.

#### Tammen Mk III Smart Carbine
A rifle with automatic target tracking. Flechette pellets can shatter and cause friendly fire.

#### Twinfire SMG
The Twinfire is an anti-personnel, twin-barrel, submachine gun manufactured by Tammen Armory. It alternates fire between two barrels for increased fire rate in close quarters. It is lightweight, maneuverable, and accurate while moving, but lacking range.

#### D-74 Saber-DMR
The D-74 Saber-DMR (Designated Marksman Rifle) is an anti-personnel, semi-automatic, rifle manufactured by Volgor Armory. It is a laser-powered, high optic, rifle that is accurate at extreme range. It has a limited capacity and rounds must be inserted one at a time.
