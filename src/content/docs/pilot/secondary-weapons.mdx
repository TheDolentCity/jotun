Jotun pilots are equipped with a secondary weapon as a backup or for specialized target scenario. Many of these weapons are only distributed to pilots.

### M-7 Blaze Sword
The M-7 Blaze Sword is an anti-personnel, anti-armor, melee weapon manufactured by Klemon Armory. The edge of the blade can reach temperatures upwards of 4500 degrees Fahrenheit and cut through all but the heaviest Jotun armor. While pilots are not specifically instructed in sword combat scenarios, many pilots descended from royal houses of the inner colonies underwent fencing training as a youth.

### M-12 Pulse Spear
The M-12 Pulse Spear is an anti-personnel, melee weapon manufactured by Dretyl Armory. It can be carried in one hand and is balanced for throwing. When the tip strikes a material that it cannot pierce, it releases a sonar ping that detects and displays enemies and points of interest on the pilot's HUD.

### M-5 Data Dagger
The M-5 Data Dagger is an anti-personnel, melee weapon manufactured by Dretyl Armory. It is both a capable combat knife and a hacking tool. When inserted into computer systems as a spike, it can allow a Pilot to hack them with their HUD interface.

### SD-4 Revolver
The SD-4 "Yippee" Revolver is an anti-personnel, high-caliber, four-cylinder revolver manufactured by Tammen Armory. The Yippee is the favored sidearm by Frontier forces who rely on it to punch through infantry body armor. It gets its nickname from the surprised expression, reaction, and "jump for joy" victims make when struck in the chest.
