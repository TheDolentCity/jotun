Building a Pilot should be fun. Most of the time, you will find yourself inside of your Jotun, but missions may require you to leave the safety of the mech frame and engage in traditional warfare.

### 1. [Choose a Primary Weapon](/pilot/primary-weapons/)
Jotun pilots are equipped with a primary weapon to protect them against infantry and inhospitable wildlife. These weapons are also carried by common soldiers of the Frontier.

### 2. [Choose a Secondary Weapon](/pilot/secondary-weapons/)
Jotun pilots are equipped with a secondary weapon as a backup or for specialized target scenario. Many of these weapons are only distributed to pilots.

### 3. [Choose an Ordnance Weapon](/pilot/ordnance-weapons/)
Jotun pilots are equipped with heavy ordnance to protect them against heavy threats like infantry battalions or auto-mechs.

### 4. [Choose a Combat Suit](/pilot/combat-suits/)
Jotun pilots are equipped with C-SUITs, enhanced combat suits to protect them and provide additional utility out in the field.

### 5. Choose a Call Sign
Roll d10 and pick one of the columns or make your own call sign. You should also have a real name in addition to your call sign.
