Jotun pilots are equipped with a primary weapon to protect them against infantry and inhospitable wildlife. These weapons are also carried by common soldiers of the Frontier.

### C-171 Carbine
The C-171 carbine is an anti-personnel, fully-automatic carbine by Tammen Armory. It is the standard rifle used by Frontier and Core worlds alike. It has few flaws as it is reliable, hard-hitting, and capable of rapid-fire. Many pilots eschew its general-use case for more specialized weapons.

### Hammer Shotgun
The CS-97 Hammer is an auto-tracking, anti-personnel shotgun made as a joint venture between Tammen and Dretyl Armory. It has an advanced AI processor installed along with a laser-based tracking device. Flechette pellets fired from the shotgun automatically identify and track the target they were fired at, resulting in higher accuracy. However, Jotun command recommended pilots stop using the Hammer shotgun. There have been numerous incidents of friendly fire and damage to the Dretyl processing unit renders the weapon inoperable.

### Saber-DMR
The D-74 Saber-DMR is an anti-personnel, semi-automatic, designated marksman rifle manufactured by Volgor Armory. It is a laser-powered, high magnification, rifle that is accurate at extreme range. A fresh energy cell must be inserted every five shots.

### Twinfire SMG
The SG-26 Twinfire SMG is an anti-personnel, twin-barrel, submachine gun manufactured by Tammen Armory. It alternates fire between two barrels for increased fire rate in close quarters. It is lightweight, maneuverable, and accurate while moving, but lacking range.
