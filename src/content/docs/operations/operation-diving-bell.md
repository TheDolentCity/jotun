COMMANDER: Major Saxon

This operation contains the details of a military strike against a jamming device constructed on the surface of the moon, Titan. Eliminating the jamming device on Titan is the number one priority of this operation.

## Operation Details
- `[PRIMARY OBJECTIVE]` Destroy planetary communications jamming device.
- `[SECONDARY OBJECTIVE]` Eliminate hostile forces.
- `[SECONDARY OBJECTIVE]` Eliminate orbital defense cannons.
- `[SECONDARY OBJECTIVE]` Retrieve any intelligence found at the location.
- `[DEPLOYMENT]` Pilot, Jotun, and marines deployed via drop ships on the other side of the moon. They will then approach the location while flying low to the ground to avoid the orbital defense cannons.
- `[EVACUATION]` A drop ship will arrive one minute after the jamming device is destroyed to retrieve you, your Jotun, and the research personnel.
- `[ENVIRONMENT]` Titan is a large moon of Saturn mostly covered in Ocean. Terraforming has led to a stable, oxygen-rich atmosphere. It has a gravity approximately one-tenth the strength of Earth.

## Location Details
Venus is a partially terraformed planet with a gravity similar to Earth's. It has an atmosphere with oxygen, but very low amounts so extended exposure requires a vacc-suit to survive. 

Meteorology reports indicate a storm is imminent. Expect high, hot winds and lots of dust. Be aware: this could impact targeting systems.

Arcadia Research Station was built in a large crater surrounded by tall rocks on Venus's surface. This recessed position helps protect the station from the worst of the dust storms.

#### Structures
- **Research Lab**: A large, ringed building with a central database and supercomputer. The team maintains and performs computation on all Sol System telemetry.
- **Generator:** An outdoor generator that harvests solar energy and stores it in batteries for later use. Several backup generators are stored inside this small building as well.
- **Primary Communications Relay:** A small building with a massive antenna and subspace engine that receives and processes faster-than-light communications.
- **Secondary Communications Relay:** A small building with a large antenna that receives and processes planetary and orbital communications.
- **Crew Quarters:** A large building like a hotel that functions as the home of the research staff. They spend most of their time here as very few individuals have to be in the research lab at a time.
- **Supply Storeroom:** A small building that contains surplus goods like food, water, and batteries. This storeroom also contains advanced medical and repair equipment in case of emergency.

## Outcome
- `[PRIMARY OBJECTIVE]` Intelligence acquired.
- `[SECONDARY OBJECTIVE]` No research personnel survived.
- `[SECONDARY OBJECTIVE]` Hostile forces neutralized. Remains captured.
- `[EVACUATION]` All pilots and jotun evacuated. "Arc" was unresponsive and sent to the medical bay at once.
