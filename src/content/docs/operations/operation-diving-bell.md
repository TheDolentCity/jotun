## Objectives

This operation contains the details of a military strike on the surface of the moon, Titan. A jamming device has been discovered recently that prevented us from properly scanning the moon. Orbital imagery has captured the construction of a hostile base on the surface where the jamming signal is strongest. Eliminating the jamming device on Titan is the number one priority of this operation.

#### `[PRIMARY]` Destroy planetary communications jamming device

All communications have been jammed within the atmosphere of Titan. All probes sent down to the moon have been lost. With this jamming device in place it is impossible to scan the moon or perform a sweep of its locations.

#### `[SECONDARY]` Eliminate hostile forces

We have little intel regarding hostile forces on Titan's surface. Orbital imagery has captured what appears to be auto-mech movement in the base. Destroy any and all hostile forces.

#### `[SECONDARY]` Eliminate orbital defense cannons.

Satellite imagery has captured images of several orbital defense cannon emplacements in the base. The orbital defense cannons prevent _Lady of the Slain_ from deploying Bifrost pods or additional reinforcements. They must be eliminated to evacuate safely.

These orbital defense cannons have very thick armor on the outside. 2nd platoon will be deployed with enough ordnance to destroy each emplacement from the inside.

#### `[SECONDARY]` Retrieve any intelligence found at the location

It is unknown when this enemy base was constructed or for what purpose. Retrieve any intelligence that indicates the purpose of this base.

#### `[SECONDARY]` Protect the drop ships

The drop ships will remain at the dropoff point for the duration of the mission. If they are destroyed, evac will not be possible until the orbital defense cannons are destroyed.

## Command and Control

The operation commander Major Samuel Saxon controls and co-ordinates the planning and execution of the operation as a whole. Once deployed, Jotun Pilots will be responsible for the execution of the operation, unless Major Samuel Saxon provides battlefield commands mid-operation.

Each platoon will operate under one pilot in the field. It is up the pilots who will coordinate each platoon.

## Allotment and Constitution of Forces

This operation includes naval and ground forces.

### Naval Forces

Three Greathammer drop ships alloted for evacuation.

### Ground Forces

#### Infantry

Three platoons allotted for this operation:

- `1st` Platoon (riflemen)
- `2nd` Platoon (combat engineers)
- `3rd` Platoon (special weapons)

#### Jotun Pilots

Three jotun pilots alloted for operation:

- Atris `ARC` COTTE
- Dak `CINDER` Breacher
- Lesie `PHOTON` Everson

## Execution of Operation

### Deployment

Pilot, Jotun, and marines deployed via three Greathammer drop ships on the other side of the moon. They will then approach the location while flying low to the ground to avoid fire from the orbital defense cannons. The ships will land near the beach to avoid enemy fire.

### Evacuation

The three Greathammer drop ships that deploy the operation forces will perform evacuation once the objectives have been completed.

## Operation Location

Titan is a large moon of Saturn mostly covered in Ocean. Terraforming has led to a stable, oxygen-rich atmosphere. It has a gravity approximately one-tenth the strength of Earth, take this into account when moving on the surface.

#### Structures

- **Hostile Base**: There is a large structure with repcon activity on the northernmost edge of the island. We suspect that this is where the jamming device is located.
- **Northwestern Orbital Cannon**: There is a heavily armored orbital cannon on the northwestern edge of the island.
- **Northeastern Orbital Cannon**: There is a heavily armored orbital cannon on the northeastern edge of the island.
- **Eastern Orbital Cannon**: There is a heavily armored orbital cannon on the eastern edge of the island.
