This operation is a first strike against an unknown fleet. The primary objective of the operation is the capture of intelligence data from a research station on Venus.

## Background
As of yet, not much is known about the Fall of Earth. Sol satellites captured images of an unknown fleet appearing through a massive subspace tear. They also captured images of destroyed orbital emplacements and Earth's surface. Cities were leveled, the atmosphere was filled with dust, and wide swaths of the world appear scorched.

Mars was quickly given the same treatment before the last of the Sol satellites were destroyed. No other United Human Colonies forces were present in the Sol system at the time.

It is unknown who constructed this fleet, what their goals are, or how many planets in the Sol system have been destroyed. The United Human Colonies are mobilizing Jotun pilots for insurrections into the system.
