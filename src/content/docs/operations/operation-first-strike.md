This operation is a first strike against an unknown fleet. The primary objective of the operation is the capture of intelligence data from the Arcadia Research Station on Venus.

## Background
As of yet, not much is known about the Fall of Earth. Sol satellites captured images of an unknown fleet appearing through a massive subspace tear. They also captured images of destroyed orbital emplacements and Earth's surface. Cities were leveled, the atmosphere was filled with dust, and wide swaths of the world appear scorched.

Mars was quickly given the same treatment before the last of the Sol satellites were destroyed. No other United Human Colonies forces were present in the Sol system at the time.

It is unknown who constructed this fleet, what their goals are, or how many planets in the Sol system have been destroyed. The United Human Colonies are mobilizing Jotun pilots for insurrections into the system.

## Operation Details
- `[PRIMARY OBJECTIVE]` Retrieve satellite data from research station.
- `[SECONDARY OBJECTIVE]` Evacuate research personnel.
- `[SECONDARY OBJECTIVE]` Capture or destroy hostile forces.
- `[DEPLOYMENT]` Pilot and Jotun deployed via Bifrost pod.
- `[EVACUATION]` A dropship will arrive ten minutes after you are deployed to retrieve you, your Jotun, and the research personnel.
- `[ENVIRONMENT]` Venus is a partially terraformed planet with a gravity similar to Earth's. It has an atmosphere with oxygen, but very low amounts so extended exposure requires a vacc-suit to survive. In addition, Meteorology reports indicate a storm is imminent. Expect high, hot winds and lots of dust.

#### Retrieve satellite data from research station
Satellite data is routed through the Arcadia research station on Venus prior to galactic transmission. We believe that their systems contain valuable intelligence including audio, video, and telemetry regarding the attack on Earth. You will be deployed with one **data spike** that can be used to retrieve and store Arcadia's database.

#### Evacuate research personnel
There are numerous scientific personnel stationed at Arcadia. Evacuate and guide them to the dropship once it arrives.

#### Capture or destroy hostile forces
We have no intel regarding hostile forces in orbit or on Venus's surface. Assume the worst. Destroy any and all hostile forces, capturing them only if it is safe to do so. You will be deployed with three pairs of **magnetic cuffs** that can be used to detain hostile forces.

## Location Details
Venus is a partially terraformed planet with a gravity similar to Earth's. It has an atmosphere with oxygen, but very low amounts so extended exposure requires a vacc-suit to survive. 

Meteorology reports indicate a storm is imminent. Expect high, hot winds and lots of dust. Be aware: this could impact targeting systems.

Arcadia Research Station was built in a large crater surrounded by tall rocks on Venus's surface. This recessed position helps protect the station from the worst of the dust storms.

#### Structures
- **Research Lab**: A large, ringed building with a central database and supercomputer. The team maintains and performs computation on all Sol System telemetry.
- **Generator:** An outdoor generator that harvests solar energy and stores it in batteries for later use. Several backup generators are stored inside this small building as well.
- **Primary Communications Relay:** A small building with a massive antenna and subspace engine that receives and processes faster-than-light communications.
- **Secondary Communications Relay:** A small building with a large antenna that receives and processes planetary and orbital communications.
- **Crew Quarters:** A large building like a hotel that functions as the home of the research staff. They spend most of their time here as very few individuals have to be in the research lab at a time.
- **Supply Storeroom:** A small building that contains surplus goods like food, water, and batteries. This storeroom also contains advanced medical and repair equipment in case of emergency.
