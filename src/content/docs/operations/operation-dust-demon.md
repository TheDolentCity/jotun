FROM:    Supreme Headquarters, Frontier Militia Forces

TO:      Major Samuel Saxon

FWD:     Atris 'ARC' COTTE,
         Dak 'CINDER' Breacher,
         Lesie 'PHOTON' Everson

SUBJECT: Operation 'Dust Demon'

DATE:    November 11th, 2597 AST
```

## Objectives

This operation contains the details of a raid of intelligence data from the Arcadia Research Station on Venus. Video and telemetry data should provide the FMF with answers regarding who destroyed Earth.

#### `[PRIMARY]` Retrieve satellite data from research station

Satellite data is routed through the Arcadia research station on Venus prior to galactic transmission. We believe that their systems contain valuable intelligence including audio, video, and telemetry regarding the attack on Earth. You will be deployed with one **data spike** that can be used to retrieve and store Arcadia's database.

#### `[SECONDARY]` Evacuate research personnel

There are numerous scientific personnel stationed at Arcadia. Evacuate and guide them to the drop ship once it arrives.

#### `[SECONDARY]` Capture or destroy hostile forces

We have no intel regarding hostile forces in orbit or on Venus's surface. Assume the worst. Destroy any and all hostile forces, capturing them only if it is safe to do so. You will be deployed with three pairs of **magnetic cuffs** that can be used to detain hostile forces.

## Command and Control

The operation commander Major Samuel Saxon controls and co-ordinates the planning and execution of the operation as a whole. Once deployed, Jotun Pilots will be responsible for the execution of the operation, unless Major Samuel Saxon provides battlefield commands mid-operation.

## Allotment and Constitution of Forces

This operation includes naval and ground forces.

### Naval Forces

One Greathammer drop ship will arrive ten minutes after the pilots arrive on the surface to retrieve the pilots, their jotun, the research personnel, and any captured hostiles.

### Ground Forces

The following pilots will be deployed along with their jotun:

- Atris 'ARC' COTTE
- Dak 'CINDER' Breacher
- Lesie 'PHOTON' Everson

## Execution of Operation

#### Deployment

Pilot and Jotun deployed via Bifrost pod.

#### Evacuation

One Greathammer drop ship will arrive ten minutes after the pilots arrive on the surface.

## Operation Details

- `[DEPLOYMENT]` Pilot and Jotun deployed via Bifrost pod.
- `[EVACUATION]` A drop ship will arrive ten minutes after you are deployed to retrieve you, your Jotun, and the research personnel.
- `[ENVIRONMENT]` Venus is a partially terraformed planet with a gravity similar to Earth's. It has an atmosphere with oxygen, but very low amounts so extended exposure requires a vacc-suit to survive. In addition, Meteorology reports indicate a storm is imminent. Expect high, hot winds and lots of dust.

## Location Details

Venus is a partially terraformed planet with a gravity similar to Earth's. It has an atmosphere with oxygen, but very low amounts so extended exposure requires a vacc-suit to survive.

Meteorology reports indicate a storm is imminent. Expect high, hot winds and lots of dust. Be aware: this could impact targeting systems.

Arcadia Research Station was built in a large crater surrounded by tall rocks on Venus's surface. This recessed position helps protect the station from the worst of the dust storms.

#### Structures

- **Research Lab**: A large, ringed building with a central database and supercomputer. The team maintains and performs computation on all Sol System telemetry.
- **Generator:** An outdoor generator that harvests solar energy and stores it in batteries for later use. Several backup generators are stored inside this small building as well.
- **Primary Communications Relay:** A small building with a massive antenna and subspace engine that receives and processes faster-than-light communications.
- **Secondary Communications Relay:** A small building with a large antenna that receives and processes planetary and orbital communications.
- **Crew Quarters:** A large building like a hotel that functions as the home of the research staff. They spend most of their time here as very few individuals have to be in the research lab at a time.
- **Supply Storeroom:** A small building that contains surplus goods like food, water, and batteries. This storeroom also contains advanced medical and repair equipment in case of emergency.

## Outcome

- `[PRIMARY OBJECTIVE]` Intelligence acquired.
- `[SECONDARY OBJECTIVE]` No research personnel survived.
- `[SECONDARY OBJECTIVE]` Hostile forces neutralized. Remains captured.
- `[EVACUATION]` All pilots and jotun evacuated. "Arc" was unresponsive and sent to the medical bay at once.
