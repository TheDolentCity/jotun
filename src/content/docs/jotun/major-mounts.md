description: A list of major mounts for Jotun.

Major mounts are larger mounting points that can hold potent equipment like radar towers or powerful anti-mech weapons like missile launchers or laser cannons.

### Blast Cannon
The SC-515 Blast Cannon is an anti-mech, anti-personnel weapon manufactured by Sarm Armory. An upscaled version of a conventional mortar, this cannon excels at firing upwards and over obstacles. The attack can be avoided due to this travel time, but slower forces will still be caught in its massive blast. Firing this weapon always triggers a "DANGER CLOSE" warning on friendly pilot HUDs. It deploys with limited ammo in the field.

### Guided Missile Launcher
The SL-71 Guided Missile Launcher is an anti-mech weapon manufactured by Sarm Armory. Firing the missile takes little effort as it eschews a targeting system. As a result, it does not automatically track any targets, but experienced Jotun pilots can guide the missile manually with a HUD-link camera. This allows for complete control of the flight path, but an occupied pilot may be unable to perform the guidance, leading to a disastrous effect.

### Heavy Chain Gun
The TH-38 Heavy Chain Gun is an anti-mech, anti-personnel weapon manufactured by Tammen Armory. It can be mounted on an arm or shoulder and is capable of dispensing more rounds downrange than any other Jotun weapon. The gun takes some time to spin up to full speed and will fire its maximum fire-rate after a few seconds. Continuous, concentrated fire is incredibly effective against armor and structures.

### Heat Lance
The VL-565 Heat Lance is an anti-mech weapon manufactured by Volgor Armory. It is typically mounted on a shoulder and is capable of charging and releasing a thin, concentrated laser beam. The beam will travel through mechs and other objects until it hits something it cannot pierce. If a pilot is willing to increase their mech's heat and energy consumption, the beam can pierce armor.

### Micro-Missile Platform
The HP-292 Micro-Missile Platform is an anti-mech, anti-personnel weapon manufactured by Hadrago Armory. First developed as a weapon of a last resort when surrounded by enemy forces, this platform launches over a thousand micro-missiles that automatically track nearby movement and strike their target, pushing them back. Firing this weapon always triggers a "DANGER CLOSE" warning on friendly pilot HUDs. It can only be fired once per deployment.

### Multi-Target Missile Launcher
The SL-423 Multi-Target Missile Launcher is an anti-mech, anti-personnel weapon manufactured by Sarm Armory. Each missile from a pod can target a unique individual on the pilot HUD. This weapon can eliminate personnel troops spread out across a battlefield or concentrate on a single target to devastating effect. It deploys with limited ammo in the field.

### Smart Turret
The TD-14 Smart Turret is an anti-mech, anti-personnel, auto-tracking weapon made as a joint venture between Tammen and Dretyl Armory. Dretyl provides the processing unit and HUD-uplink that controls the flight path of each round fired. The turret has a slow fire rate and its caliber is only capable of piercing light mech armor.

### Smoke Cannon
The HC-87 Smoke Cannon is a unique weapon manufactured by Hadrago Armory. Firing the cannon will blanket a large area in thick smoke that obscures vision. If the smoke is struck by an incendiary weapon, it will combust, leaving a blanketed area of fire that melts through mech armor. Firing this weapon always triggers a "DANGER CLOSE" warning on friendly pilot HUDs. It deploys with limited ammo in the field.
