### Guided Missile Launcher
The SA-14 Guided Missile Launcher is an anti-mech weapon by Sarm Armory. Firing the missile takes little effort as it eschews a targeting system. As a result, it does not automatically track any targets, but experienced Jotun pilots can guide the missile manually with a HUD-link camera. This allows for complete control of the flight path, but an occupied pilot may be unable to perform the guidance, leading to a disastrous effect.
