description: The list of Jotun frames.

Jotun frames come in all shapes and sizes. The [standard frame](/jotun/frames#standard-frame) is the most commonly selected as it supports the widest use cases, but veterans may choose more specialized frames to support their preferred tactical options.

### Assault Frame
The Assault Frame is average sized at 20 feet tall. It is a modified version of the Standard Frame, sacrificing a major weapons mount for increased speed. It also benefits from a strengthened motor system that increases its effectiveness at traversing harsh terrain and grappling opposing mechs.

| Size | Speed | Armor | Mounts |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Medium | High | Medium | 2 Minor, 1 Main |

### Hulk Frame
The Hulk Frame is a large frame at 30 feet tall. It was designed for heavy war zones where extreme firepower and armor were required. It is the only frame with hands and motors built to support two main weapon mounts simultaneously.

| Size | Speed | Armor | Mounts |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Large | Low | High | 2 Main, 1 Major |

### Jet Frame
The Jet Frame is average sized at 20 feet tall. It shuns armor to accommodate a rocket engine. The engine can hover with ease or perform a full-speed vertical takeoff. However, it is unable to fly properly and is more commonly used for slow aerial repositioning. This frame is extremely dangerous, as any disruption of the engine while in flight will end in disaster.

| Size | Speed | Armor | Mounts |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Medium | Medium | Low | 1 Main, 2 Major |

### Monolith Frame
The Monolith Frame is by far the largest Jotun frame at 40 feet tall. It has to be to support its colossal weapon mount, but as a result main and minor mounts are incompatible with this frame. It is also built with stabilizer gyros that increase its long range accuracy and help prevent it from moving from one spot.

| Large | Low | High | 1 Major, 1 Colossal |

### Recon Frame
The Recon Frame is average sized at 20 feet tall. On paper it seems like a downgrade from the Assault frame, but it sacrifices armor and an enhanced motor system for an active camouflage system. This includes a large generator and many enviro-projectors across the frame. The camouflage leaves a slight optical sheen when active and the Jotun-level enviro-projectors can obscure you from heat and computer sensors. The active camouflage generator recharges quickly, but only lasts for a short time.

| Size | Speed | Armor | Mounts |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Medium | High | Low | 2 Minor, 1 Main |

### Standard Frame
The Standard Frame is average sized at 20 feet tall, but don't take it for granted. It is a massive war machine with access to a variety of mounts. Versatile and without flaws, the standard frame is the most used frame for a reason.

| Size | Speed | Armor | Mounts |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| Medium | Medium | Medium | 2 Minor, 1 Main, 1 Major |

### Super-Soldier Frame
The Super-Soldier Frame is far-below average size at 10 feet tall. In fact, it is little more than mech-tier armor around a C-SUIT equipped with thrusters that provide the wearer with full flight control. While the suit can withstand mech weaponry and fly, it is unable to mount most mech weapons. Pilots instead wield their normal weapons. This frame also does not support an A.I. unit.
