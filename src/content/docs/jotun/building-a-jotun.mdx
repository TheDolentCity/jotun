## Process

### 1. Choose a Frame
A Jotun's frame determines its size, speed, armor, and available mounts. Most frames have additional bonuses that specialize their use within field operations.

### 2. Choose a Main Mount
A main mount refers to equipment designed to be held in a Jotun's two hands. Every Jotun has a bipedal build with two arms that mimics that of a human. These are almost always weapons.

### 3. Choose Minor Mounts (if applicable)
Minor mounts are smaller mounting points that can only hold specialized equipment. Oftentimes these mounts have more utility than lethality.

### 4. Choose Major Mounts (if applicable)
Major mounts are larger mounting points that can hold potent equipment like radar towers or powerful anti-mech weapons like missile launchers or laser cannons.

### 5. Choose Colossal Mount (if applicable)
A mount so large that equipment mounted on it dwarfs the Jotun itself. Very few Jotun are built to hold such mounts, but they can be used to devastating effect.

### 6. Create Jotun Name
Roll 2d10 to determine the two words that make your Jotun name or make your own name.
| d10 | First | Second |

| 6 | Fullmetal | Psychopomp |
| 7 | Meridian | Prime |
| 8 | Nova | Ranger |
| 9 | Solar | Vanguard |
| 0 | Stonewall | Wolf |

### Jotun Mounts
Mounts represent locations on the Jotun that equipment and weapons can be installed. Every Jotun frame has access to a variety of mounts, but it's worth noting that every frame has access to the main mount.
