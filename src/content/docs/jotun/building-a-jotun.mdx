### Jotun Mounts
Mounts represent locations on the Jotun that equipment and weapons can be installed. Every Jotun frame has access to a variety of mounts, but it's worth noting that every frame has access to the main mount.

#### Minor Mount
A smaller mounting point that can only hold specialized equipment. Oftentimes these mounts have more utility than lethality.

#### Main Mount
A main mount refers to equipment designed to be held in a Jotun's two hands. Every Jotun has a bipedal build with two arms that mimics that of a human. These are almost always weapons.

#### Major Mount
A larger mounting point that can hold potent equipment like radar towers or powerful anti-mech weapons like missile launchers or laser cannons.

#### Colossal Mount
A mount so large that equipment mounted on it dwarfs the Jotun itself. Very few Jotun are built to hold such mounts, but they can be used to devastating effect.
