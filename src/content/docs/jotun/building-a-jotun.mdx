Building a Jotun should be fun. Don't worry about min-maxing or stats. If your Jotun falls apart you can always rebuild it differently.

### 1. [Choose a Frame](/jotun/frames/)

A Jotun's frame determines its size, speed, armor, and available mounts. Most frames have additional bonuses that specialize their use within field operations.

### 2. [Install Main Mount](/jotun/main-mounts/)

A main mount refers to equipment designed to be held in a Jotun's two hands. Every Jotun has a bipedal build with two arms that mimics that of a human. These are almost always weapons.

### 3. [Install Minor Mounts](/jotun/minor-mounts/)

Minor mounts are smaller mounting points that can only hold specialized equipment. Oftentimes these mounts have more utility than lethality.

### 4. [Install Major Mounts](/jotun/major-mounts/)

Major mounts are larger mounting points that can hold potent equipment like radar towers or powerful anti-mech weapons like missile launchers or laser cannons.

### 5. [Install Colossal Mount](/jotun/colossal-mounts/)

A mount so large that equipment mounted on it dwarfs the Jotun itself. Very few Jotun are built to hold such mounts, but they can be used to devastating effect.

### 6. [Install AI](/jotun/auto-mech-ai/)

An auto-mech AI helps pilots perform all of their tasks and manage sub-routines for the Jotun such as scanning and evaluating reactor stability. Importantly, they are capable of autonomously operating the Jotun when the pilot leaves the seat empty. These AI developer their own personalities over time.

### 7. Create Jotun Name
