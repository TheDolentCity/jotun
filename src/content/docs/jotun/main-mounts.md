### Heavy Machine Gun
The TH-6 Railgun is an anti-mech, electro-magnetic cannon by Hadrago Armory. It is a sniper Jotun weapon, capable of great accuracy and damage at a distance. Each shot requires an extensive charge up time before firing though and once the cylinder runs empty there is no way to reload the weapon in the middle of a mission.
