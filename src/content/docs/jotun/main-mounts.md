title: Main Mounts
description: A list of main mounts for Jotun.
---

A main mount refers to equipment designed to be held in a Jotun's two hands. Every Jotun has a bipedal build with two arms that mimics that of a human. These are almost always weapons.

### Barbed Axe
The EM-62 Barbed Axe is an anti-mech axe manufactured by Escheron Armory. It is a heavy melee weapon with barbs that catch and tear into armor. Targets struck by this axe are unable to move until the axe is freed from their mech.

### Claymore
The EM-8 Claymore is an anti-mech sword manufactured by Escheron Armory. It is a powerful and potent melee weapon, capable of severing mech limbs and piercing cockpits. It is extremely durable and excels as a defensive option when confronted with an opposing mech in melee.

### Energy Siphon Rifle
The DR-28 Energy Siphon Rifle is an anti-mech, anti-system rifle manufactured by Dretyl Armory. The rifle launches an arc of electricity that drains the power systems of the target. The arc will return power to the operating Jotun as well. This weapon does not inflict physical damage, but can be used to fully disable a system on its targets or power the operator's systems.

### Hammer Shotgun
The TS-75 Hammer Shotgun is an anti-mech, anti-personnel weapon manufactured by Tammen Armory. It is a standard Jotun weapon, excelling at destroying mechs and light infantry at close ranges. Even mechs with heavy armor will be knocked over or pushed around by the Hammer's heavy fire.

### Heavy Machine Gun
The TH-38 Heavy Machine Gun is an anti-mech, anti-personnel, rapid-fire machine gun manufactured by Tammen Armory. A standard Jotun weapon, capable of eliminating an infantry platoon in seconds or chewing through light mech armor. It has few flaws beyond requiring a drum magazine reload after continuous fire.

### Laser Rifle
The VR-77 Laser Rifle is an anti-mech weapon manufactured by Volgor Armory. It is a standard Jotun weapon, excelling at hitting targets at long ranges with perfect accuracy. It doesn't cause massive damage, but it fires quickly, has no recoil, and is easy to aim. If a pilot is willing to increase their mech's heat and energy consumption, shots can pierce armor.

### Light Knives
The DM-43 Light Knives are an anti-mech, anti-armor, hand modification manufactured by Dretyl Armory. Instead of carrying a melee weapon, the Jotun's hands are augmented with focused plasma projectors. When activated, twin daggers extend from the Jotun's wrists. The focused plasma can cut through any mech armor, but have a significantly short range.

### Plasma Cannon
The HC-6 Plasma Cannon is an anti-mech, electro-magnetic cannon manufactured by Hadrago Armory. It is a sniper weapon, capable of launching bolts of plasma with great accuracy up to a mile away. Each shot requires an extensive charge up time before firing though and once the cylinder runs empty there is no way to reload the weapon in the middle of a mission.

### Rocket Fists
The EM-17 Rocket Fists are an anti-mech, hand modification manufactured by Escheron Armory. Instead of carrying a melee weapon, the Jotun's fists and elbows are augmented with thrusters that when activated provide immediate and extreme kinetic force. Blows from these fists will send most mechs flying in the opposite direction. If the jotun is not stable, it will also be launched in the direction opposite the impact.

### Tachyon Claws
The EM-44 Tachyon Claws are an anti-mech, anti-armor, hand modification manufactured by Escheron Armory. Instead of carrying a weapon, the Jotun's hands are augmented with sharp, curled claws made from an extremely durable alloy. These claws are capable of tearing any mech armor to shreds. They are also very useful for climbing and grappling.

### Tidal Shield
The EM-80 Tidal Shield is a defensive utility manufactured by Escheron Armory. It is little more than naval ship armor plating constructed in the shape of a towering Jotun shield. It is resistant to all but the strongest anti-armor weapons. While not the most effective melee weapon, a strong Jotun can slam it into a foe and send them flying.
