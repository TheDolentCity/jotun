title: Auto-mech AI
description: The list of Jotun auto-mech AI.
---

An auto-mech AI helps pilots perform all of their tasks and manage sub-routines for the Jotun such as scanning and evaluating reactor stability. Importantly, they are capable of autonomously operating the Jotun when the pilot leaves the seat empty. These AI develop their own personalities over time.

### Guardian
The Guardian A.I. was engineered by Tammen Armory. It is a standard A.I. as it will simply stay close to its pilot, laying down fire on enemy forces or physically shielding the pilot from damage as it sees fit. While it has little downsides, it has been found to be far less effective than a Jotun pilot in combat.

### Hunter
The Hunter A.I. was engineered by Escheron Armory. They found that most A.I. armed with their weaponry were too reserved and they wanted an offensive option instead. A Hunter Jotun has two modes to pick from: autonomous and targeted. In autonomous mode, it will detect the nearest armed force and attack it without regard for whether or not they are the enemy. In targeted mode, it will track and pursue a single target selected by the pilot. Once this target is destroyed, the A.I. will wait for new orders and fall into autonomous mode after some time. Unlike most auto-mech A.I., Escheron found that the Hunter A.I. was nearly equal in effectiveness as a Jotun pilot as long as it was equipped with melee weaponry. 

### Sentinel
The Sentinel A.I. was engineered by Sarm Armory. It was originally a modified version of Sarm's rocket tracking technology. When activated, a Sentinel Auto-mech will stay in one location and keep a 360 degree awareness at all times. If it detects a non-friendly, armed force it will engage it with whichever weapon would be most lethal at that range. 

### Watchdog
The Watchdog A.I. was engineered by Volgor Armory. It was built as a long-range support option, oftentimes eschewing attacks in favor of defensive utilities for itself and allies. It will attempt to stay out of range of enemy fire and attack targets closest to its allies when support options are unavailable.
