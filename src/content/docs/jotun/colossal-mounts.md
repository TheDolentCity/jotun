title: Colossal Mounts
description: A list of colossal mounts for Jotun.

A mount so large that equipment mounted on it dwarfs the Jotun itself. Very few Jotun are built to hold such mounts, but they can be used to devastating effect.

### Magnetic Rail-Cannon

The HC-01 Experimental Magnetic Rail-Cannon is an anti-orbital weapon manufactured by Hadrago Armory. It is a minified form of the naval rail-cannons deployed at the forefront of Frontier naval destroyers. It utilizes an electro-magnetic charge rail to deliver a kinetic round at velocities that negate any form of armor. It is an effective weapon against infantry, mechs, structures, and ships. It requires an extensive charge-up time prior to firing, during which time the Jotun cannot move.

### Laser Cutter

The HS-77 Laser Cutter is an anti-armor weapon manufactured by Hadrago Armory. It is an upscaled-version of an orbital shipbreaker's incision tool, which can cut through the heaviest naval armor. The emitter can be configured by the Pilot to shoot a fine needle-line continuously for several seconds or a wide arc in a shotgun-like blast. Once fired, it takes significant time to cool and the energy cell must be replaced.

### Flame Projector

The KP-20 Flame Projector is an anti-mech, anti-armor, incendiary weapon manufactured by Klemon Armory. **It is restricted in use by the Frontier against living beings.** When activated, thermite flames pour out in a long, wide arc in front of the Jotun, melting anything in its path. The weapon may need to be reloading intermittently, but the larger danger is that the wielding Jotun will overheat with continuous use.

### Shield Generator

The DU-900 Shield Generator is a defensive utility manufactured by Dretyl Armory. It allows the wearer to construct and project energy shields that slow or destroy incoming kinetic and energy weaponry. The default setting projects a circular shield around a target within line of sight, but the Pilot can increase or decrease the size easily. Its maximum size could encompass a large battalion or ten medium Jotun in proximity. Once the shield is broken, it takes a long time for it to recharge.
