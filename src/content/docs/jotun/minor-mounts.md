description: A list of minor mounts for Jotun.

Minor mounts are smaller mounting points that can only hold specialized equipment. Oftentimes these mounts have more utility than lethality.

### Arc Mine
The DD-50 Arc Mine is an anti-system weapon manufactured by Dretyl Armory. It must be engaged and placed on solid ground before it can be activated. Remote activation is possible with a detonator or it can be configured so that any mechanical system that approaches will activate the mine. When activated, arcs of electricity shoot out of the mine and overwhelm computer systems. Arcs will jump between nearby sources of electricity, heightening the effect the more systems that are chained.

### Flare Revolver
The KR-7 Flare Revolver is an anti-mech, anti-armor, incendiary weapon manufactured by Klemon Armory. The flare will lodge itself onto the outside of a mech and slowly burn a hole towards its center. It must be manually reloaded.

### Motor Shock Grenade Launcher
The DL-98 Motor Shock Grenade Launcher is an anti-system weapon manufactured by Dretyl Armory. This grenade does not have a large radius nor does it have an activation delay. On impact with any object, it fires arcs of electricity that disable systems for a moment. It is most effective at halting the mechanical movement of a mech. The launcher is not capable of firing great distances.

### Plasma Bayonet
The VM-4 Plasma Bayonet is an anti-mech weapon manufactured by Volgor Armory. It can be attached to a mech's forearm, or for longer reach, as an under-barrel attachment to acceptable main weapon mounts. The plasma does not ship with a large enough power supply to pierce armor. If a pilot is willing to increase their mech's heat and energy consumption though, the bayonet can reach a temperature where it can pierce armor.

### Revolver
The TR-56 Revolver is an anti-mech, anti-armor weapon manufactured by Tammen Armory. The revolver is an extremely high-caliber, loading what is essentially four tank rounds in a Jotun-sized sidearm. It must be manually reloaded.

### Ripper Teeth
The EU-61 Ripper Teeth are a defensive utility by Escheron Armory. The Jotun is outfitted with sharp teeth across its entire frame. Any target that strikes or grapples with the Jotun will be shredded no matter what part of the Jotun touches them.

### Rocket Boots
The M-2 Rocket Boots are a mobility utility by Tammen Armory. When activated, the Jotun will perform a boosted jump. Skilled pilots may also use this as a weapon, but that tends to launch the Jotun sideways at a great speed and crash into something.

### Shredder Flares
The KU-5 Shredder Flares are a defensive utility by Klemon Armory. When activated, a flurry of small flares is launched from crevices across the Jotun's frame. This will spoof targeting systems and can even destroy approaching missiles. As an addendum, particularly reckless pilots will use these flares as a weapon against grappled targets, burning through their armor while holding them tight.
