## Dice Categories
Each dice size has a category and different interpretations for each face. When a check is required, the GM will tell the player which dice they think is most appropriate and roll. There are the following six dice types:
- Desperate (d4)
- Reliable (d6)
- Ineffective (d8)
- Chaotic (d10)
- Effective (d12)
- Dangerous (d20)

## Dice Results
Each dice type provides several narrative dice results. These can impact the success of a character's intended actions and other effects from the shifting battlefield. There are seven dice results:
- Disaster
- Failure
- Disadvantage
- Chaos
- Advantage
- Success
- Triumph

### Disaster
The player fails to accomplish their goal. The GM introduces a new problem, serious danger, or character that wasn't in the scene prior.

### Failure
The player fails to accomplish their goal.

### Disadvantage
This result does not affect success or failure. Instead, a small problem, danger, or damaging change for the player characters occurs.

### Chaos
This result is neither positive nor negative. It represents a drastic shift in the situation. This might mean a dogfight between two outlaw ships is suddenly interrupted by a giant military armada. The players should work together to come up with a way that the goals of every character in the scene shift due to a random event.

### Advantage
This result does not affect success or failure. Instead, a small boon or helpful change for the player characters occurs.

### Success
The player accomplishes their goal.

### Triumph
The player accomplishes their goal. The GM comes up with a solution to an existing problem, negates a serious danger, or introduces a character that wasn't in the scene prior.
